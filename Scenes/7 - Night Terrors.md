[[Okan]] jerks awake. It is dark. Something has woken him, a nagging feeling of danger which becomes intense as he struggles to sit up. He can feel an odd sensation, almost as if something is pulling at him from the direction of the small window on the far side of the room. He shakes his head to clear it. Moonlight is dimily shining in through the window and as he moves slightly to peer out, a shadow passes across it, blocking the light for a few seconds.

[[Okan]] slips out of bed, his feet making little noise on the floor.

The door creaks loudly as he eases it open, the hinges shrill in the silence of the night. He winces, pulling it open enough to slip through into the darkened corridor. As he does so he sees [[Kaapo]]'s door is already open and the young man is standing with his hand on the latch of [[Sakari]]'s door. [[Kaapo]] jumps as [[Okan]] whispers - "Did you feel it too? Something's outside."

> [!oracle] Did the something hear the creaking door?
> **Twist Roll:** 5
> **Twist:** None
> **Roll:** 3
> **Outcome:** No but...

[[Kaapo]] nods, his eyes wide in the gloom. There is no noise from downstairs and only an occasional distant noise from the city outside. [[Kaapo]] pushes open the door of [[Sakari]]'s room and jumps again. The kahru is standing just inside the door, his dark shape almost invisible in the gloom. His voice is a low growl - "You feel it? Something comes."

[[Kaapo]] and [[Okan]] both nod. The window in [[Sakari]]'s room is smaller than in the other rooms and is set to one side such that it can be approached without anyone ... or anything ... outside seeing. [[Sakari]] pads across the floor and peers out into the night.

> [!oracle] Is the something outside?
> **Twist Roll:** 1
> **Twist:** Ruthlessly Shocking
> **Roll:** 4
> **Outcome:** Yes but...

[[Sakari]] peers through the window. His voice is a low rumbling whisper - "Nothing there... but I feel something." - Moonlight glints on something in the shadows next to him and [[Okan]] realises the kahru is holding his axe in one powerful paw.

"What do we do?" - [[Kaapo]]'s whisper is strained, thin and reedy in the gloom.

[[Okan]] whispers back - "We can't stay in here. If it's some sort of threat, we'll be caught like rats in a trap. I'd say we go downstairs, see if we can catch a glimpse of it."

[[Sakari]] is already moving, his huge frame silent in the darkness as he slips through the open door. As he passes them he whispers - "Follow. I go first."

> [!roll] Do they get down the stairs quietly?
> **Result:** 1

As they sneak quietly down the stair, [[Kaapo]] trips on a step and tumbles forwards. [[Sakari]] tries to catch him.
