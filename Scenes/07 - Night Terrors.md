[[Okan]] jerks awake. It is dark. Something has woken him, a nagging feeling of danger which becomes intense as he struggles to sit up. He can feel an odd sensation, almost as if something is pulling at him from the direction of the small window on the far side of the room. He shakes his head to clear it. Moonlight is dimily shining in through the window and as he moves slightly to peer out, a shadow passes across it, blocking the light for a few seconds.

[[Okan]] slips out of bed, his feet making little noise on the floor. He grabs his blade and pads across to the door.

> [!roll] Okan being stealthy as he crosses the room and slips out of the door.
> **Result:** 2 - Fail

The door creaks loudly as he eases it open, the hinges shrill in the silence of the night. He winces, pulling it open enough to slip through into the darkened corridor. As he does so he sees [[Kaapo]]'s door is already open and the young man is standing with his hand on the latch of [[Sakari]]'s door. He is dressed and his satchel is slung over his shoulder. [[Kaapo]] jumps as [[Okan]] whispers - "Did you feel it too? Something's outside."

> [!oracle] Did the something hear the creaking door?
> **Twist Roll:** 5
> **Twist:** None
> **Roll:** 3
> **Outcome:** No but...

[[Kaapo]] nods, his eyes wide in the gloom. There is no noise from downstairs and only an occasional distant noise from the city outside. [[Kaapo]] pushes open the door of [[Sakari]]'s room and jumps again. The kahru is standing just inside the door, his dark shape almost invisible in the gloom. His voice is a low growl - "You feel it? Something comes."

[[Kaapo]] and [[Okan]] both nod. The window in [[Sakari]]'s room is smaller than in the other rooms and is set to one side such that it can be approached without anyone ... or anything ... outside seeing. [[Sakari]] pads across the floor and peers out into the night.

> [!oracle] Is the something outside?
> **Twist Roll:** 1
> **Twist:** Ruthlessly Shocking
> **Roll:** 4
> **Outcome:** Yes but...

[[Sakari]] peers through the window. His voice is a low rumbling whisper - "Nothing there... but I feel something." - Moonlight glints on something in the shadows next to him and [[Okan]] realises the kahru is holding his axe in one powerful paw.

"What do we do?" - [[Kaapo]]'s whisper is strained, thin and reedy in the gloom.

[[Okan]] whispers back - "We can't stay in here. If it's some sort of threat, we'll be caught like rats in a trap. I'd say we go downstairs, see if we can catch a glimpse of it."

[[Sakari]] is already moving, his huge frame silent in the darkness as he slips through the open door. As he passes them he whispers - "Follow. I go first."

> [!roll] Do they get down the stairs quietly?
> **Result:** 1 - Fail

As they sneak quietly down the stair, [[Kaapo]] trips on a step and tumbles forwards. [[Sakari]] tries to catch him.

> [!roll] Sakari tries to catch Kaapo as he falls
> **Result:** 5 - Success

The kahru's arm whips out and he grabs the young man by the arm as he tumbles, stopping his fall. He sets [[Kaapo]] carefully back on his feet and then looks at him through the gloom. His voice is a low growl - "Quietly my friend." They continue down the stair to the bottom and then slip along the corridor to the door of the taproom. It is deserted, the windows shuttered, the glow of the hearth the only light. [[Sakari]] murmurs - "Wait here. I go to look." and he slips quietly down the corridor towards the front of the tavern.

[[Okan]] and [[Kaapo]] enter the empty bar. [[Kaapo]] pads over to the fireplace and warms his hands over the glowing embers. [[Okan]] pads over to the bar - he could do with a pick me up and this is too good a chance to miss.

> [!oracle] Has the landlord been killed by the something?
> **Twist Roll:** -
> **Twist:** None
> **Roll:** 6
> **Outcome:** Yes and...

[[Okan]] steps around the end of the bar and begins to examine the bottles there. He's looking for something bracing. As he moves along he draws level with the door behind the bar that leads into the corridor to the kitchens. He glances down the corridor and freezes.

The back door of the tavern is swinging open. Moonlight is streaming in, outlining the huge shadowed shape which is standing in the doorway, its head down. As [[Okan]] looks, the shadow creature lifts its head in a jerking motion. [[Okan]] sees that a body is on the floor beneath it's seemingly clawed feet. It rips something from the body, something that drips on the floor with a spattering sound. Then the thing pauses. The shadowed head slowly turns towards [[Okan]] and he knows it has seen him. He steps backwards, hurriedly backing away.

"Kaapo... Kaapo!!! It's here. It's in the corridor."

There's a sound of something large moving in the corridor, the scrape of claws on the wooden floor. [[Okan]] backs into the bar, casting about for some sort of barricade. [[Kaapo]] is scrabbling with his bag, pulling something out, moving towards [[Okan]].

The padding steps and scrape of claws stops. There is silence. Then suddenly, with preternatural agility, the creature leaps through the doorway and onto the bar. It's bulk is huge, the size of a small pony and it is wreathed in shadows. Its pelt seems almost liquid, rippling over bunched muscles as it moves. The head is large, huge jaws open in a snarl with too many teeth jutting out. The eyes are deep pits with no reflection of light. It pauses for a moment and then leaps into the room towards them.

[[Okan]] and [[Kaapo]] yell in shock as the creature leaps at them. [[Okan]] dives to one side, rolling across the floor to get out of the way (Move), slashing out with his blade as he does so (Attack).

> [!roll] Attack - Okan slashes at the creature
> **Result:** 4 - Miss

The creatures twists aside and [[Okan]]'s knife flashes past. As he rolls he hears [[Kaapo]] shouting words of magic.

> [!roll] Test - Kaapo casts fire at the creature (2HP on success)
> **Result:** 5

Suddenly there is a burst of firey light as [[Kaapo]] finishes the spell (Attack). His hands are stretched out towards the creatures and a gush of flame blasts towards it, catching it's full length. It howls in pain and twists away.

> [!roll] Evade - The creature attempts to dodge the flames
> **Result:** 3

The creature's agility does not save it however and there is a terrible stench of scorched fur as the flames wash over it. It howls and roars in pain. It lashes out with a massive clawed paw at [[Okan]].

> [!roll] Attack - Creatures claws Okan
> **Result:** 3

[[Okan]] manages to roll out of the way. The creature slashes at him again.

> [!roll] Attack - Creature slashes a Okan again
> **Result:** 4

[[Okan]] scrambles away and the creature's claws gouge tears into the wooden floor. He shouts "SAKARI!! ITS HERE!!!" They need the kahru's axe!

> [!oracle] Has Kaapo's spell set fire to the inn?
> **Twist Roll:** -
> **Twist:** None
> **Roll:** 6
> **Outcome:** Yes and...

> [!abstract] Initiative
> - Okan - 6
> - Kaapo - 5
> - Creature - 10

The creature spins with horrible agility and leaps at [[Kaapo]], claws outstretched on both the massive front paws.

> [!roll] Attack - Creature claws at Kaapo
> **Result:** 2

> [!roll] Attack - Creature claws at Kaapo
> **Result:** 4

[[Kaapo]] manages to scramble out of the way, tugging at the dagger in his belt as he does so.  [[Okan]] begins to throw things at the creature - books, logs from the fire, anything!

> [!roll] Attack - Okan throws things
> **Result:** 4

> [!roll] Attack - Okan throws more things
> **Result:** 4

The books and logs seem to just bounce off the creature or go whistling past it. [[Kaapo]] bravely jumps forwards attempting to slash it with his dagger.

> [!roll] Attack - Kaapo slashes with his dagger
> **Result:** 5

The creature roars as his blade bites deep.

> [!roll] Attack - Kaapo stabs again
> **Result:** 6

He whips the knife away and slashes again. Blood sprays from the wound and the creature howls. It leaps back, the shadows closing around it as bounds over the bar counter, down the corridor and out into the night.

Okan and Kaapo stand for a moment, panting, trying to catch their breath. Then Kaapo says - "Oops!" - flames from his spell are licking along the bar top. Okan rushes over and begins to beat them out with his coat. Kaapo joins him.

> [!oracle] Do they manage to put the fire out before it does a lot of damage?
> **Twist Roll:** 2
> **Twist:** None
> **Roll:** 4
> **Outcome:** Yes but...

They beat the flames out but not before they have scorched the bar top badly. As they are doing so, other guests begin to appear, having been woken by the tumult. There are cries of alarm and horror as they find the remains of the landlord in the corridor.

> [!oracle] Are Okan and Kaapo accused of murdering him?
> **Twist Roll:** 2
> **Twist:** None
> **Roll:** 5
> **Outcome:** Yes

As Okan and Kaapo explain what happened the crowd begins to turn rather nasty. There are shouts of "Liars!" and "I don't trust goblinkin!". Okan senses the crowd is turning ugly and begins to edge to the door, Kaapo with him.

Someone in the crowd yells "Grab them! Call the militia!! Murderers!!!". Okan seizes the opportunity, mutters "Run!!!" to Kaapo and sprints down the corridor, past the landlord's body and out into the street, Kaapo on his heels.
