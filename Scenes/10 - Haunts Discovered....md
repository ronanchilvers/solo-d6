Sakari shifts a little, easing cramped muscles. He is seated, uncomfortably, on cold stone behind a large mausoleum. He has been sitting for some time watching the entrance to a smaller building a little way off, the entrance through which the creature from the tavern vanished a little while ago. He could see it was wounded and easily tracked it through the streets of the Trades Ward to the edge of the City of the Dead, Waterdeep's huge park and cemetery. Now he sits waiting to see if anyone else arrives.

He shifts position again and then freezes as he sees a figure approaching. The sky is just beginning to lighten - sunrise isn't far off.

> [!roll] Test - Can Sakari see who the figure is?
> **Result:** 6

He peers through the gloom and sees a figure, dressed in the livery of Lady Devdan - Okan had described it after their visit to her. It is a man, tall and thin with a grim look on his face. He wonders if it is the unpleasant butler, [[Ranjeet]] that Okan mentioned. The man disappears inside the building.
