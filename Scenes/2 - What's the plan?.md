"I know what that smell is" - [[Okan]]'s voice is low and he leans across the table towards his companions. 

> [!oracle] Is it the smell of fine tobacco?
> **Twist Roll:** 5
> **Twist:** None

> **Outcome:** No and...

[[Kaapo]] picks up the box and sniffs it. The scent is pungent, overpowering and seems to stick in his nose. 

"Yuck! It's horrible. Weirdly horrible."

> [!oracle] Is it the scent of a drug some criminals take to aid their nefarious activities?
> **Twist Roll:** 5
> **Twist:** None
> **Roll:** 6
> **Outcome:** Yes and...

[[Okan]] leans forward, speaking in low tones.

"Before I arrived in Waterdeep, before I met you two, I spent some time down south in Baldur's Gate. I met a warrior there. He was named Fanir. He had worked with a group of warriors and thieves for a time and told me some of their secrets. It seems that when they had need of a little more luck or surety about their activities, they sometimes take a drug which gives them ... an advantage. He had a little with him - it had exactly that scent."

[[Kaapo]]'s face has gone a little white - "Warriors? Thieves? Ad.. advantage? That sounds dangerous! We don't want that sort of trouble... do we?"

[[Okan]] looks at him askance - "_We're_ thieves and warriors you idiot!" - he shakes his head - "Sometimes, I wonder if you're in the right trade Kaapo!"

[[Sakari]] has been sniffing at the box.

> [!roll] Does he notice the secret compartment?
> **Result:** 3

His voice is its usual low growl - "Smells weird to me." - He tosses it onto the table - "Food? I'm hungry" - [[Okan]] stares at him - "How is it that you can eat your body weight in meat and still be hungry 10 minutes later? Can't understand it..." - [[Sakari]] shrugs - "I like food." - [[Okan]] nods - "That you do, my massive friend! That you do!"

[[Kaapo]] picks up the box and begins to fiddle with it as [[Okan]] says - "So - firstly, we have a performance drug for warriors and thieves. Secondly we have this bit of... skin?" - He picks up the fragment of skin and examines it again. Then he holds it out to [[Sakari]] - "You know what this is from? You've probably eaten whatever animal it came from at some point!"

> [!roll] Does Sakari recognise the fragment of skin?
> **Result:** 1

[[Sakari]] sniffs it and a speck of drool drips onto the table. [[Okan]] snatches the fragment back just as the kahru lifts it to his open jaws. "Don't eat it you great oaf! Can't you control yourself? By Gruumsh's hairy arse - buy yourself some food!" [[Sakari]] shrugs and hefting his huge frame up from the table, sets off for the bar. [[Okan]] shouts - "And bring me another beer while you're at it!"

> [!roll] Does Kaapo discover the secret compartment in the box?
> **Result:** 4,4,6

[[Kaapo]] is still fiddling with the box. Suddenly there is a _click_ and he says 

"Ah ha! I thought so!!"

The bottom of the box lifts and then slides out to reveal a small secret compartment inside. [[Okan]] leans forwards eagerly - "What's that inside?". [[Kaapo]] lifts out something small, wrapped in a piece of cloth.

> [!oracle] Is the item something which might help identify the owner of the box?
> **Twist Roll:** 5
> **Twist:** None
> **Roll:** 6
> **Outcome:** Yes and...

[[Kaapo]] unwraps the cloth, which is a piece of fine linen. Wrapped carefully within is a small pendant of green jade mounted in silver. On the back there is a message engraved in flowing script - "To darling Wellby from his snookums". For a moment both [[Okan]] and [[Kaapo]] stare, first at the inscription and then at each other. [[Okan]] starts to giggle, followed by [[Kaapo]] and when [[Sakari]] returns to the table he finds them both in helpless fits of laughter.

> [!question] Thread
> - [ ] #thread Who is Wellby? 

"What's so funny? Have I got something on my face?" - he is carrying a large tray of food which he dumps on the table with a loud thud. [[Okan]] wipes his eyes - "Only your usual starved expression my formidable friend!"

> [!oracle] Does anyone notice the hilarity?
> **Twist Roll:** 6
> **Twist:** None
> **Roll:** 2
> **Outcome:** No

Eventually, [[Okan]] and [[Kaapo]] calm themselves down. [[Okan]] says

"Well we have a good lead. We need to find darling Wellby" he sniggers as he says it "and see if he wants his box and his locket back. I wonder if there's an easy way we could get the word out that we have it without arousing suspicion..."

Between mouthfuls of meat, [[Sakari]] says "Mmmspapssh"

[[Kaapo]] frowns - "Sorry Saki? Didn't quite catch that."

[[Sakari]] swallows and clears his throat - "Newshpapersh. Like thish." - He pushes a greasy scrap of paper across the table. It is a torn fragment of a newspaper - the Waterdeep News. The headline and first few words of an article are readable through the grime - "Man Wounds Self, Vanishes!".

[[Okan]] grabs it - "Excellent! We'll place an advert - shouldn't be more than a few coppers. Something like 'Found! Small wooden box. On the corner of Villars Lane. Enquiries to the Splintered Stair, Dock Ward." He frowns. "Small chance of the right person seeing it but you never know."

> [!question] Thread
> - [ ] #thread Place an advert in the Waterdeep News 

"Right!" He continues - "I'm going to go and see about this newspaper thing and then I'll start making some discreet enquiries about the pendant. Saki, you go with Kaapo and see if you can find a sage or hunter or something, someone who can tell you what creature that skin belongs to."

> [!question] Thread
> - [ ] #thread Find a sage to identify the fragment of skin 

He pushes his chair back - "Meet you back here later!" - he turns to go and then pauses, turns back again - "I'd better take the cash - I'll need to pay for the newspaper ad and so on."

Before the others can argue, he's gone.
