"I know what that smell is" [[Okan]]'s voice is low and he leans across the table towards his companions. 

> [!oracle] Is it the smell of fine tobacco?
> **Twist Roll:** 5

[[Kaapo]] picks up the box and sniffs it. The scent is pungent, overpowering and seems to stick in his nose. 

"Yuck! It's horrible. Weirdly horrible."

> [!oracle] Is it the scent of a drug some criminals take to aid their nefarious activities?
> **Twist Roll:** 5
> **Twist:** None
> **Roll:** 6
> **Outcome:** Yes and...

[[Okan]] leans forward, speaking in low tones.

"Before I arrived in Waterdeep, before I met you two, I spent some time down south in Baldur's Gate. I met a warrior there. He was named Fanir. He had worked with a group of warriors and thieves for a time and told me some of their secrets. It seems that when they had need of a little more luck or surety about their activities, they sometimes take a drug which gives them ... an advantage. He had a little with him - it had exactly that scent."

[[Kaapo]]'s face has gone a little white - "Warriors? Thieves? Ad.. advantage? That sounds dangerous! We don't want that sort of trouble... do we?"

[[Okan]] looks at him askance - "_We're_ thieves and warriors you idiot!" - he shakes his head - "Sometimes, I wonder if you're in the right trade Kaapo!"

[[Sakari]] has been sniffing at the box.

> [!roll] Does he notice the secret compartment?
> **Result:** 3

His voice is its usual low growl - "Smells weird to me." - He tosses it onto the table - "Food? I'm hungry" - [[Okan]] stares at him - "How is it that you can eat your body weight in meat and still be hungry 10 minutes later? Can't understand it..." - [[Sakari]] shrugs - "I like food." - [[Okan]] nods - "That you do, my massive friend! That you do!"
