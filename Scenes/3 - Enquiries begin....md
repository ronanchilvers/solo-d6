> [!scene] Okan attempts to make enquiries about the pendant and it's owner
> **Weather:** Heavy rain
> **Location:** Waterdeep
> **Scene roll:** 2
> **Scene Type:** Dramatic scene

It's pouring with rain by the time [[Okan]] reaches the newspaper offices and he is drenched. It costs him 2 nibs (coppers) to place the advert for the next run of the paper.

> [!question] Thread
> - [ ] #thread Does the advert in the Waterdeep News  work?

The door of the office closes behind him with a jingle of the bell and he stands for a moment on the step, reluctant to get soaked. He decides to visit a couple of his less savoury friends to see if they can shed any light on who Wellby is. He pulls his coat around him and sets off through the rain. 

He is heading for the Jolly Guardian tavern in the Dock Ward, hoping to run into a particular acquaintance. He threads his way through the streets and crowds until he finds himself walking down Dock Street. Ahead of him. At the junction with Fish Street he can see the tavern, a two storey building with double fronted windows. Two large humans in overcoats are standing outside the main door, under cover of a low porch. The rain is still pouring down and they are clearly fed up with standing out here instead of inside.

[[Okan]] walks up to the door but as he starts up the steps to the door, the bouncers move to block his way.

"Tavern's closed little man." - the bouncers's voice is harsh - "Come back another time."

The huge man looks down at [[Okan]] with a steady gaze, his companion doing the same thing. [[Okan]] smiles.

"Good afternoon gentlemen. I was just hoping for a quick bracer out of the rain. Is there not a space for a small damp goblinkin such as myself in this fine establishment?"

"Like I said - tavern's closed."

[[Okan]] nodded enthusiastically - "Yes I understand completely. Closed - of course. I was just wondering if a generous patron such as myself might be able gain entrance for... shall we say two dragons each to the good cause of you choice?"

The bouncer looks down at him, his face impassive. Then he says

"Make it three."

[[Okan]] winces - he's spending the advance [[Lina Devdan|Lady Devdan]] gave them quite quickly, but... *think of the prize!* - he says to himself - *think of the future rewards*. He counts out 3 dragons to each of them.

"Now - I'll go in and get my drink."

The bouncers move aside, pocketing their spoils. One of them pats him on the head as he passes. He makes a mental note to spit in their beer if he ever gets the chance.

The interior is gloomy and smells slightly of damp dogs for some reason. There is a moderate blaze in a stone fireplace to one side and tables and chairs are dotted around. It strikes [[Okan]] that the tavern is quite full for somewhere that's supposed to be closed. He looks around to see if he can see the acquaintance he is looking for.

> **Twist Roll:** -
> **Twist:** None
> **Roll:** 6

[[Okan]] has begun to pick his way through the crow when he hears a familiar voice from the back of the tavern, gruff, growling and raised to a ridiculous volume.

"Woe!! Woe I say!! Prithee good knight, vouchsafe to me thy goodly ... ... Shut up Francio, I know it... vouchsafe to me they goodly blade for then I shall ... ... What? It doesn't say that... Don't tell me I don't know the words Francio or you know what you'll get!"

[[Okan]] sighs. Some things never change and [[Armas Valtaistuin]] certainly hasn't!!
