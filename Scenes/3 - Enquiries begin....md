It's pouring with rain by the time [[Okan]] reaches the newspaper offices and he is drenched. It costs him 2 nibs (coppers) to place the advert for the next run of the paper.

The door of the office closes behind him with a jingle of the bell and he stands for a moment on the step, reluctant to get soaked. He decides to visit a couple of his less savoury friends to see if they can shed any light on who Wellby is. He pulls his coat around him and sets off through the rain. 

He is heading for the Jolly Guardian tavern in the Dock Ward, hoping to run into a particular acquaintance. He threads his way through the streets and crowds until he finds himself walking down Dock Street. Ahead of him. At the junction with Fish Street he can see the tavern, a two storey building with double fronted windows. Two large humans in overcoats are standing outside the main door, under cover of a low porch. The rain is still pouring down and they are clearly fed up with standing out here instead of inside.
