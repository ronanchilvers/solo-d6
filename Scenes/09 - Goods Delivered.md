The halfling is nervous but he doesn't show it. He stands waiting to be called forward. He can still feel the effects of the Arachnid tingling in his limbs but he controlled it, forcing his hands to remain still. The room is only half lit, two lanterns flickering in the gloom behind him. After what seems like an age a voice calls his name-

"Wellby Half-finger. Come forward."

He straightens his shoulders and steps forward into the centre of the room. He bows low. A voice says

"Wellby. You have carried out your allocated task?"

"I have my lords."

"And. You have that which we sought?"

"I do my lords"

He lifts his hands. Held in them is a small, glittering, jewelled cup. There is a rustle of cloth as if several people had shifted in their seats. When the voice comes again, it is eager sounding and barely above a whisper.

"Excellent! Set it down and leave. You shall be well rewarded."

Wellby does as he is told and sets down the cup on the stone floor. He straightens and says

"Might I be permitted a request?"

A pause. Then - "Speak."

"I was led to believe that this task might elevate me in the eyes of the council. Might I request that the council considers me for more ... sensitive tasks in the future?"

Another pause.

"We shall consider your request. Leave."

Wellby bows and backs out of the room. Once outside, he breathes a sigh of relief. His hands are trembling. He clenches them, his left hand rising to his throat to grip... his pendant! The loss of the precious pendant hits him again and he grits his teeth in anger. His contact has already passed him the details of the thieves and by now Macha should have news of them. He turns and strides away, his mind filled with hate...
