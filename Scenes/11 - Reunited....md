Okan jerks awake to find the early sunrise sneaking through the shutters. He groans quietly and stretches out the kinks in his arms and back. *That's what you get if you sleep in a wooden chair!* he thinks to himself.

He stretches and then, seeing Kaapo still sleeping, accidentally-on-purpose scrapes his chair on the floor, making a loud screech. Kaapo wakes with a jump - "Whassat!! Where... wha..."

Okan does his best concerned voice - "Oh I am sorry Kaapo - my chair creaked a bit there and I was trying to be so careful and not wake you up!"

Kaapo blinks and yawns, rubbing his eyes - "No problem Okan. No problem at all... probably time I woke up anyway!"

Okan goes in search of some tea or coffee and finds [[Rauf]] in the kitchen behind the bar, already up and having his own breakfast. The man is distant and cold but offers Okan breakfast. Kaapo joins him and they eat breakfast, a fairly silent affair since [[Rauf]] refuses to be drawn into conversation in any way.

Finally, [[Rauf]] says - "You realise of course that [[Armas Valtaistuin|Master Valtaistuin]] will expect re-payment of his hospitality. He will expect a service from you commensurate with the service he has provided."

Okan only just stops himself describing how uncomfortable the chairs were in graphic detail and instead says - "We shall be only too delighted to oblige Armas. We'll be on our way now - if you could pass on our best regards I'd be very grateful" - he grins broadly, giving the man a good view of his canines! [[Rauf]] sniffs and nods.

They take their leave and find themselves on the street outside. It isn't long after dawn and the streets glitter wetly in the morning sun. Other townsfolk are going about their business.

Okan scratches his head - "Well my friend - we have a problem. We have a murder on our hands, Sakari is gods know where and we still need to find this damned cup if we're to have any chance of getting our cash. We have some decisions to make about our next steps I think!"

Kaapo is looking up the street. He grins widely - "Well that's one problem fixed Okan. Look!" - He points and Okan turns to see the huge shape of Sakari walking down the street towards them. He is eating a large leg of meat, holding it in one hand while he walks and tearing off chunks with his teeth. He sees them and a large grin spreads across his face, bits of the meat falling from his jaws as he does so.

"Okan! Kaapo!! I thought I might find you here!"

Okan shakes his head - "At least we've all had a good breakfast!"

Later, the three of them are sitting on the dock. Okan is eating an apple that he managed to pilfer as they made their way to the waterfront. They are at the less salubrious end of the docks, down by Spices Street. The tide is out and the mud flats are shimmering in the morning sun, small burps of gaseous fumes occasionally disturbing the surface. Sakari is seated with his back against a barrel and Kaapo is sitting cross legged next to him, reading his books.

"So high and mighty Ranjeet, eh?" - Okan's tone is triumphant - "I thought there was something odd about him! I bet he tipped off our unknown friend Wellby. Probably told him how to get in! Probably let him in!!"

Sakari burps - "'Scuse me... So do we go and see the lady? Fill her in on progress a little?"

Okan taps his chin with a long finger - "I think we need a bit more proof that there's some funny business going on with old Ranjeet. We know where he lives and we know where he meets his nefarious friends. I think we need to know what's in that building, maybe set a trap for him. Who was he meeting there?"

"Might have to kill that cat thing" - Sakari's voice is matter of fact - "It might not like us going in there."

Okan grins - "That, my massive friend, is where you come in. I'm sure you can knock some sense into it if needs be." - He looks at Kaapo - "Kaapo? Kaapo!! Have you heard a word we've said?" - Kaapo nods - "Of course - Ranjeet is involved somehow and we're going to go and see what's in the building Saki found."

Okan stares at him for a moment - "Yes... exactly right." - He throws the apple core into the mud of the dock and stands up - "Let's go then. Strike while the iron is hot and all that. I much prefer graveyards in the daylight!"

They gather their things and set off towards the City of the Dead.
