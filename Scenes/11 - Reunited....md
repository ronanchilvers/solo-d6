Okan jerks awake to find the early sunrise sneaking through the shutters. He groans quietly and stretches out the kinks in his arms and back. *That's what you get if you sleep in a wooden chair!* he thinks to himself.

He stretches and then, seeing Kaapo still sleeping, accidentally-on-purpose scrapes his chair on the floor, making a loud screech. Kaapo wakes with a jump - "Whassat!! Where... wha..."

Okan does his best concerned voice - "Oh I am sorry Kaapo - my chair creaked a bit there and I was trying to be so careful and not wake you up!"

Kaapo blinks and yawns, rubbing his eyes - "No problem Okan. No problem at all... probably time I woke up anyway!"

Okan goes in search of some tea or coffee and finds [[Rauf]] in the kitchen behind the bar, already up and having his own breakfast. The man is distant and cold but offers Okan breakfast. Kaapo joins him and they eat breakfast, a fairly silent affair since [[Rauf]] refuses to be drawn into conversation in any way.

Finally, [[Rauf]] says - "You realise of course that [[Armas Valtaistuin|Master Valtaistuin]] will expect re-payment of his hospitality. He will expect a service from you commensurate with the service he has provided."

Okan only just stops himself describing how uncomfortable the chairs were in graphic detail and instead says - "We shall be only too delighted to oblige Armas. We'll be on our way now - if you could pass on our best regards I'd be very grateful" - he grins broadly, giving the man a good view of his canines! [[Rauf]] sniffs and nods.

They take their leave and find themselves on the street outside. It isn't long after dawn and the streets glitter wetly in the morning sun. Other townsfolk are going about their business.

Okan scratches his head - "Well my friend - we have a problem. We have a murder on our hands, Sakari is gods know where and we still need to find this damned cup if we're to have any chance of getting our cash. We have some decisions to make about our next steps I think!"

Kaapo is looking up the street. He grins widely - "Well that's one problem fixed Okan. Look!" - He points and Okan turns to see the huge shape of Sakari walking down the street towards them. He is eating a large leg of meat, holding it in one hand while he walks and tearing off chunks with his teeth. He sees them and a large grin spreads across his face, bits of the meat falling from his jaws as he does so.

"Okan! Kaapo!! I thought I might find you here!"

Okan shakes his head - "At least we've all had a good breakfast!"
