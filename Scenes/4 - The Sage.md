Sakari and Kaapo reluctantly leave the [[The Splintered Stair|Splintered Stair]] and head out into the pouring rain. Kaapo begins to shiver violently the moment he is outside - "I'll be fine - don't worry. I'll be ok." - He glanced at Sakari and realises the kahru isn't looking at him and hasn't heard a word he said.

They are at a loss initially of where to go. They end up wandering through the streets trying to find a sign or speak to someone who can tell them where they might a sage. Eventually after some time in the rain, they learn of an elderly gnome who may be able to help them. His name is [[Pallabar Reddlepop]] and he lives near Pressbow Lane, a little way from [[The Splintered Stair]]. They make their way there but can't find the address. The rain is lashing down now, soaking them through. [[Sakari]] is stoically unmoved by the weather but [[Kaapo]] is deeply fed up.

They are on the point of giving up when the door of a nearby house opens and a small figure steps out. The figure is dressed in some sort of enormous contraption, rather like a huge tent suspended from a set of poles sticking out of a hat. The figure steps straight out into the middle of the street and stands stock still as if waiting. Then it slowly begins to turn on the spot, pirouetting with the utmost care. [[Kaapo]]man's [[Sakari]] can see that it is a small, very elderly gnome. His eyes blink violently all the time and he has a habit of screwing up his long nose to try to push his rather bent glasses up it again. [[Kaapo]] says quietly - "That could be him. Stay here." - and sets off across the street. The gnome jumps in shock when [[Kaapo]] greets him.
