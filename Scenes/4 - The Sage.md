Sakari and Kaapo reluctantly leave the [[The Splintered Stair|Splintered Stair]] and head out into the pouring rain. Kaapo begins to shiver violently the moment he is outside - "I'll be fine - don't worry. I'll be ok." - He glanced at Sakari and realises the kahru isn't looking at him and hasn't heard a word he said.

Kaapo says - "Saki! Hey - SAKI!!" - the kahru turns his great head to look at him - "I think the obvious place to go is the [[Font of Knowledge]]. It's in the Castle Ward. Someone there will know what poor creature that scrap came from." [[Sakari]] cocks his head in one side, thinking.

"Food at this Font of Whatever?" 

[[Kaapo]] begins to explain that it's a temple and has no food but then changes his mind - "Yes! All you can eat!"

Sakari nods - "Let's go."

They begin to make their way along the street, [[Kaapo]] trying to stay out of the largest puddles but failing often. It takes them around 15 minutes to walk the length of the Castle Ward to the Temple of Oghma known as the [[Font of Knowledge]]. They arrive to find the doors of the usually open temple shut fast. There is no answer when they knock and then pound on the doors. Much the irritation of several dedicated worshippers sitting nearby.
