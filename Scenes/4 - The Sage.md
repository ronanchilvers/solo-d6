Sakari and Kaapo reluctantly leave the [[The Splintered Stair|Splintered Stair]] and head out into the pouring rain. Kaapo begins to shiver violently the moment he is outside - "I'll be fine - don't worry. I'll be ok." - He glanced at Sakari and realises the kahru isn't looking at him and hasn't heard a word he said.

They are at a loss initially of where to go. They end up wandering through the streets trying to find a sign or speak to someone who can tell them where they might a sage. Eventually after some time in the rain, they learn of an elderly gnome who may be able to help them. His name is [[Pallabar Reddlepop]] and he lives near Pressbow Lane, a little way from [[The Splintered Stair]]. They make their way there but can't find the address. The rain is lashing down now, soaking them through. [[Sakari]] is stoically unmoved by the weather but [[Kaapo]] is deeply fed up.

They are on the point of giving up when the door of a nearby house opens and a small figure steps out. The figure is dressed in some sort of enormous contraption, rather like a huge tent suspended from a set of poles sticking out of a hat. The figure steps straight out into the middle of the street and stands stock still as if waiting. Then it slowly begins to turn on the spot, pirouetting with the utmost care. [[Kaapo]] and [[Sakari]] can see that it is a small, very elderly gnome. His eyes blink violently all the time and he has a habit of screwing up his long nose to try to push his rather bent glasses up it again. [[Kaapo]] says quietly - "That could be him. Stay here." - and sets off across the street. The gnome jumps in shock when [[Kaapo]] greets him.

"Pallabar Reddlepop?" - [[Kaapo]] wipes the rain out of his eyes as he speaks. The gnome looks askance at him for a second and then says - "I am he! Who are you?"

[[Kaapo]] explains that they are looking for someone to help them identify a piece of animal skin, a skin that no one seems to recognise. [[Pallabar Reddlepop|Pallabar]] invites them inside and after disentangling himself from the contraption, asks to see the skin. [[Kaapo]] takes it out to show him.

> [!oracle] Pallabar recognises the skin

The gnome nods when he sees it, his eyes widening.

"Gracious goodness!!! I had not thought to see evidence of these creatures again, or rather I had *hoped* I would not! I am not surprised it is unknown to you. Only a few know of the creature's existence." 

He scuttles over to a pile of books, grabs one (causing the rest to collapse), and scuttles back to Kaapo and Sakari, who has accompanied his friend into the gnome's shop. [[Pallabar Reddlepop|Pallabar]] leafs through the pages until - "Ah!! Here it is." - he flips the book open and turns it to face them.

The book seems to be some sort of catalogue of creatures. On the left hand page is a partial description of a creature, continued from the page before. On the right is a coloured painting, an artist's impression. The creature it shows is big, the size of a small pony, and cat like with too many teeth crowding it's open mouth. It has a whip-like tail and is crouched as if ready to spring. It's shape is indistinct, cloaked with darkness.

The gnome whispers - "A Shadowclaw Lynx. A terrible creature - intelligent and brutal. The fragment of skin you have comes, indisputably from the hide of a Shadowclaw Lynx." He looks up at them over his glasses that have once again slid down his nose, his eyes twitching alarmingly.

"They are rarely seen, indeed I know of no one who has encountered one for many years. Their skin was often sold as an ingredient in various rather dark rituals of which I shall not speak. There were rumours that some brave souls had managed to communicate with one or two specimens and even form bonds of friendship but I very much doubt the veracity of the claim. I suspect that one would be too busy being eaten to attempt polite conversation!!" He chuckles rather thinly and then looks up at [[Kaapo]] again.

"All I can advise, my young friend, is that you tread carefully. Even with the aid of your superb kahru "
