[[Okan]] makes his way across the bar room of [[The Jolly Guardian]] towards the loud voice which seems to be declaiming poetry at the same time as swearing at those around it. At the back of the bar is a small side room in which is three figures - two seated and one standing. [[Okan]] recognises [[Armas Valtaistuin]], the leader of the [[Shatterfists]] gang. A huge brown kahru, [[Armas Valtaistuin|Armas]] is nearly 9 feet in height and powerfully built. He wears a ridiculously bright suit of velveteen breeches and jacket which are stretched over his massive frame. He has several earrings in his ears and seems to have darkened the fur around his eyes with make-up.

"OKAAANN!!!" - the kahru roars, showing an impressive set of pearly white canine teeth - "My favourite theatre critic!!! Come, sit down - listen to my latest monologue. It is the lay of Villiful the Brave as he fights for the honour of his lady love."

[[Okan]] enters the room - "Armas! Good to see you! ... And hear you!!" - he smiles broadly - "I thought such potent delivery as I heard when I entered the establishment could only come from the lips of a skilled orator such as yourself!"

[[Armas Valtaistuin|Armas]] roars with laughter and claps [[Okan]] on the back with a huge paw, knocking the wind out of him.

"This is Francio, my master playwright ... although" - he adds in a theatrical whisper - "I could probably do a better job myself! Man's an idiot!"

Francio turns pale at this, stands up, gathers his papers together and with a - "By your leave, Lord Armas" - sweeps out of the room without a second word. [[Armas Valtaistuin|Armas]] slumps down into a chair. 

"The problem is, no one can write material of sufficient quality to match my skill. It all falls flat when faced with talent such as mine." - He waves at a barmaid walking past. She nods and hurries off to the bar. - "There was a time when good playwrights were ten-a-nib. Now you're lucky to get one that knows which end of the quill has the ink on it." - He sighs theatrically and throws his head back - "Meanwhile I am left, devoid of material, bereft of the performance that I crave. I weep, Okan, I really do - fuck knows what the world is coming to!"

[[Okan]] leans forward - "Write your own material Armas - only a performer of your stature can fully understand how to create material befitting your level. I think you're flogging a dead horse trying to find someone to do it for you."

[[Armas Valtaistuin|Armas]] laughs again - "Ah Okan! Always the compliments drip from your silver tongue!" - He leans forward and clasps [[Okan]]'s shoulder - "I've missed it!!"

He sits back - "However I'm not yet senile enough to know that you want something."

[[Okan]] assumes a hurt countenance - "Armas! I'm hurt!! I'm merely seeking the benefit of your great knowledge and wisdom." - When [[Armas]] just raises an eyebrow and looks at him sideways he continues - "I'm looking for someone. Someone by the name of Wellby. Someone who might be in a profession which may cause their name to be discovered in connection with dealings of a less ... savoury nature. Ring any bells with you?"

> [!oracle] Does Armas know the name Wellby?
