[[Okan]] makes his way across the bar room of [[The Jolly Guardian]] towards the loud voice which seems to be declaiming poetry at the same time as swearing at those around it. At the back of the bar is a small side room in which is three figures - two seated and one standing. [[Okan]] recognises [[Armas Valtaistuin]], the leader of the [[Shatterfists]] gang. A huge brown kahru, [[Armas Valtaistuin|Armas]] is nearly 9 feet in height and powerfully built. He wears a ridiculously bright suit of velveteen breeches and jacket which are stretched over his massive frame. He has several earrings in his ears and seems to have darkened the fur around his eyes with make-up.

"OKAAANN!!!" - the kahru roars, showing an impressive set of pearly white canine teeth - "My favourite theatre critic!!! Come, sit down - listen to my latest monologue. It is the lay of Villiful the Brave as he fights for the honour of his lady love."

[[Okan]] enters the room - "Armas! Good to see you! ... And hear you!!" - he smiles broadly - "I thought such potent delivery as I heard when I entered the establishment could only come from the lips of a skilled orator such as yourself!"

[[Armas Valtaistuin|Armas]] roars with laughter and claps [[Okan]] on the back with a huge paw, knocking the wind out of him.

"This is Francio, my master playwright ... although" - he adds in a theatrical whisper - "I could probably do a better job myself! Man's an idiot!"

Francio turns pale at this, stands up, gathers his papers together and with a - "By your leave, Lord Armas" - sweeps out of the room without a second word. [[Armas Valtaistuin|Armas]] slumps down into a chair. 

"The problem is, no one can write material of sufficient quality to match my skill. It all falls flat when faced with talent such as mine." - He waves at a barmaid walking past. She nods and hurries off to the bar. - "There was a time when good playwrights were ten-a-nib. Now you're lucky to get one that knows which end of the quill has the ink on it." - He sighs theatrically and throws his head back - "Meanwhile I am left, devoid of material, bereft of the performance that I crave. I weep, Okan, I really do - fuck knows what the world is coming to!"

[[Okan]] leans forward - "Write your own material Armas - only a performer of your stature can fully understand how to create material befitting your level. I think you're flogging a dead horse trying to find someone to do it for you."

[[Armas Valtaistuin|Armas]] laughs again - "Ah Okan! Always the compliments drip from your silver tongue!" - He leans forward and clasps [[Okan]]'s shoulder - "I've missed it!!"

He sits back - "However I'm not yet senile enough to know that you want something."

[[Okan]] assumes a hurt countenance - "Armas! I'm hurt!! I'm merely seeking the benefit of your great knowledge and wisdom." - When [[Armas]] just raises an eyebrow and looks at him sideways he continues - "I'm looking for someone. Someone by the name of Wellby. Someone who might be in a profession which may cause their name to be discovered in connection with dealings of a less ... savoury nature. Ring any bells with you?"

> [!oracle] Does Armas know the name Wellby?
> **Twist Roll:** -
> **Twist:** None
> **Roll:** 2
> **Outcome:** No

[[Armas Valtaistuin|Armas]] ursine brows crease in concentration - "Wellby? Wellby... nothing springs to mind immediately, I must admit. Since it's you, I can make some enquiries. You'll owe me though Okan - don't forget." - For a moment his eyes focus on [[Okan]] and the goblinkin sees the coldness in those dark depths.

"Much appreciated Armas! Anything you can discover would be most useful. Of course, you can call on me any time - it would be my honour to assist you with any small undertaking you might be engaged in. My honour indeed."

[[Armas Valtaistuin|Armas]] nods and then his attention is distracted by the arrival of the barmaid with a tray of tankards - "Ah!! Sustenance! FRANCIO!!! Where is the lazy bastard? FRANCIO!!! You'll have to excuse me Okan - the muse calls and I must answer!"

[[Okan]] bows - "Of course! Far be it from me to cause delay in the delivery of such oratory as yours!" - he bows a theatrically low bow and retreats out of the room, the embattled playwright Francio passing him as he does so. As he walks back across the bar he hears again the raised voice of [[Armas Valtaistuin|Armas]] declaiming verse.

He steps out onto the street. The rain is still lashing down and the evening is beginning to draw in, gloomy and windswept. The two bouncers are huddled back in the porch and barely give him a second glance as he steps past them. He pulls his cloak around his shoulders and sets off along Fish Street, heading towards [[The Splintered Stair]].

> [!oracle] Is everything as expected in the street?
> **Twist Roll:** -
> **Twist:** None
> **Roll:** 2
> **Outcome:** No

[[Okan]] is dreaming of a warm fire and full tankard of beer when he sees, a little way along the street, a small child - a little boy - running towards him. He has a cap on and is drenched in the rain. As Okan approaches him, the boy trips over, slipping in a puddle and sliding to a stop just in front of the goblinkin. Okan stoops to help him up.

> [!roll] To see if Okan notices anything untoward
> **Result:** 5

As he stoops, Okan notices something a little way up the street, barely visible in the rain. There is a darker shadow in the gloom of an alleyway entrance a little further along. Something huge is crouching in the darkness there. The boy is struggling to get up and Okan realises the child is in a panic. His attention is diverted for a moment and when he looks back at the alley, the shadow is gone. He pulls the boy to his feet.

"There you go son. Take care in the rain - its easy to slip."

The boy wrenches his arm free looking back with terror - "Let go! Let go!!! It's coming!" 

[[Okan]] frowns down at him - "What's coming?"

"The creature! It's coming!!" - the boy pulls his arm free of [[Okan]]'s grip and runs away up the street, vanishing into the gloom. [[Okan]] looks after him for a moment, then back at the alley. Nothing.

He pulls his cloak a tighter around him and sets off, following a different path that will not take him near the alley entrance.
