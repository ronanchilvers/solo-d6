Okan walks slowly around the dais in the centre of the room, staring hard at the ground - "There must be another way out of here. That creepy dude didn't just vanish, surely!"

Sakari is chopping bits of the lynx corpses, much to Kaapo's disgust! "Do you have to do that Saki? Its horrible" - The kahru shrugs - "How else will I know I killed them? Ah - that's better!" - An lynx ear tears free and he straightens up, tucking the remnant into his armour. Kaapo shakes his head - "Truly disgusting."

> [!roll] Test - Okan to find a hidden entrance in the dais
> **Result:** 4

Okan shakes his head - "There's nothing here. Not a thing! There must be some way other way out of here - I feel it in my bones! Kaapo - can you do something to help? Wave your hands around or something?"

Kaapo scratches his head - "I'm not sure what I'd do. Hold on - let me look at my scrolls."
