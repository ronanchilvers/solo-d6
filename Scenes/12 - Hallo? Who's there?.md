The three adventurers are hunkered down behind a large stone mausoleum, a little way away from the building Sakari saw Ranjeet enter.

Okan squints against the sunshine and shades his eyes with his hands - "Can't see much from this distance. We need to get closer. Let's keep an eye on it for a little while and then wander over if nothing happens."

They wait for a while, probably half an hour. Sakari nods off and begins snoring very quietly, much to Okan's horror. He gives the kahru a kick to wake him up. Eventually Okan says - "I think we should wander over there. See what's happening, if anything."

Sakari suddenly growls low in his throat. He grabs Okan's arm - "Who is that?" - he points. A small figure is making its way towards the building. It is cloaked and hooded, the hood pulled down over its face. The figure is walking purposefully towards the building entrance. Okan whispers - "Let's let him go in and then we go over there. Are there any windows or any other way he can get out?"

Sakari shakes his head - "Don't think so. Think it's just the one entrance."

Okan nods - "Right. Saki - you and I will sneak over there and get a peek in the doorway. Kaapo - you can move a bit closer to the building and keep an eye out for anything untoward." Kaapo nods. They begin to creep towards the building through the surrounding monuments and mausoleums.

> **Result:** 5

Kaapo is following a little way behind. Okan suddenly hears a gasp and then a crunching, crumbling sound. He looks back and sees Kaapo half submerged in a grave. He had put his foot on the wrong part of one of the smaller tombs and it gave way, his foot plunging through into the coffin beneath.
