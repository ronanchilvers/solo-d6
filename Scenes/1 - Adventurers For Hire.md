[[Sakari]] growls low in his throat. The morning sunshine is making him grumpy. He's too hot and hasn't had a decent meal since yesterday.

"This is taking too long! Are we lost?"

[[Okan]] looks at him with a shocked expression on his face - "Lost? Me? Saki I'm deeply, deeply hurt. When have I ever led us astray?"

[[Kaapo]] is slightly breathless - he's been struggling to keep up with Saki's long strides and Okan's skipping fast walk - "Oh never! Well, hardly ever. There was that time last week in the City of the Dead when we were looking for that headstone and yesterday of course when we tried to find that tavern. Oh and also when we wanted to get passage on that ship from Neverwinter and you took us to the wrong one and the time when..."

"ALRIGHT! ... Alright. All explainable, honest errors." [[Okan]] glares at the young man. "Did you have any breakfast? You look like you're about to pass out."

"I'm fine - don't mind me!" [[Kaapo]]'s smile is not convincing.

They cross the High Road, having walked up Snail Street from the lodgings at the Splintered Stair inn in the Dock Ward, and follow the Street of Tusks up to the turn into Vellar's Lane.

"Here we are!" [[Okan]] sounds pleased with himself. "Right on time too!" A distant bell chimes the hour.

They are standing outside a moderately well appointed town house - nothing too fancy but well kept. [[Okan]] confidently walks up to the front door and raises his hand. Then he pauses.

"Saki - it might be worth you hanging around out here. Just in case. Don't want them to get intimidated by you!" He grins then mutters to [[Kaapo]] as he turns back and raps on the door - "Besides, the big lump might try to eat the furniture!"

[[Sakari]] shrugs his massive shoulders - "Fine by me. I'm going to get some food." He turns and stomps off along the street.

> [!roll] UNE - Roll for the steward who opens the door
> **Result:** 78 - depress, 29 - academia, 80 - Ranjeet

The door swings open, revealing a steward dressed in smart uniform.

"Yes?" His tone is curt and he looks them up and down with distaste. [[Okan]]'s manner is a lesson in politeness as he sweeps a bow and says

"We are here to meet the most esteemed Lina Devdan. We understand she has had a little trouble and desires our assisstance in setting matters right?"

The man frowns - "Wait." - and closes the door. [[Kaapo]] smiles weakly at [[Okan]] - "He seems a little out of sorts." [[Okan]] nods - "That, my friend, is the understatement of the year!"

After a few minutes the door opens, wider this time, and the steward looks out at them - "Enter. Quickly please - my lady is very busy."

[[Okan]] makes a point both of hurrying ostentatiously into the hall and scuffing a little mud onto the floor once he's in, seemingly inadvertently. [[Kaapo]] follows, apologising for being slow and then apologising for apologising.

They are led into a large room, well furnished but not too opulent. A woman is seated at the far side of the room. She is elderly, maybe mid 70s, but her eyes have a sharpness to them. She has a singularly long nose. She smiles as they enter the room.

"Welcome gentlemen. Please come in and seat yourselves. Ranjeet - wine for our guests."

The steward bows, glares at them and leaves, presumably to bring wine. [[Okan]] again does his politest bow.

"My lady - it is a delight to meet you and yes, a small glass of wine would be most welcome. The day is hot and the streets are dusty. Ones throat becomes parched, I find."

[[Lady Devdan]] smiles and indicates a couple of chairs opposite her. 

"Please, sit."

[[Okan]] and [[Kaapo]] oblige her and sit down. Lady Devdan says

"Thank you for coming to see me - I am most grateful. This is a sorry business and I am most willing to pay a suitable amount to someone who can discover the truth of it for me."

[[Okan]] bows again - "If we can help, it will be our pleasure."

[[Lina Devdan]] tells them that a couple of tendays ago someone broke into her house and stole an item of great value.

> [!roll] Perilous Wilds - Determine the item
> **Result:** 6 - Utility Item, 4 - Decanter/vessel/cup

> [!oracle] Is the item magical?
> **Twist Roll:** 4
> **Twist:** None
> **Roll:** Extremely likely - 4
> **Outcome:** Yes but...

She describes the item as an heirloom which has been in her family for many hundreds of years. It is a small, jewell encrusted cup of significant value. She says that she desperately wants it found and although she doesn't know who took it, the thieves left a couple of clues behind them. The first is a small piece of cloth or sacking which was found stuck on a nail in the window which they broke in through. She brings it out and shows it to [[Okan]] and [[Kaapo]]. It seems to be made of some sort of animal skin.

> [!roll] To see if Kaapo recognises the animal skin
> **Result:** 1,1,3

[[Kaapo]] examines the fragment but shakes his head - "Not an animal that I'm aware of. Okan?" [[Okan]] takes the fragment and examines it.

> [!roll] To see if Okan recognises the animal skin
> **Result:** 2,2

He shakes his head - "No idea. Smells funny though!" - He wrinkles his nose in distaste.

"There was also this." - [[Lina Devdan|Lady Devdan]] holds out er hand in which is a small wooden box, about the size of her palm. The wood is dark, fine grained and the workmanship is clearly excellent.

[[Okan]] takes the box and lifts the lid. Lifting it to his nose, he sniffs.
