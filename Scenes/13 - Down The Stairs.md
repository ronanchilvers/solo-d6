> [!scene] The characters make their way down the stairs to discover what lies beneath the mausoleum
> **Weather:** Fair
> **Location:** City Of The Dead, Waterdeep
> **Chaos Factor:** 5
> **Scene Type:** Altered

The stair is dark and as they descend the darkness deepens. Sakari stops, his huge form just visible in the gloom. 

"We need light - Kaapo, anything you can do?"

The young mage whispers back - "Hold on. Let me try." Sakari and Okan hear a faint mumbling and muttering.

> [!roll] Test - Kaapo to create a small light
> **Result:** 6

A small orb of light glimmers faintly in the darkness and then brightens a little, allowing them to see the stairway. It floats forward just ahead of Sakari who nods - "Good work." He turns and begins to cautiously descend again. The staircase leads downwards for 30 or 40 steps. At the bottom they find themselves in a narrow corridor. Kaapo sends the glowing light ahead of them a little way.

> [!roll] Test - Stealth roll
> **Result:** 4

They creep forward down the corridor the light gleaming palely in the darkness. They've not gone far when they see ahead of them a glimmer of torchlight.

> [!oracle] Are they noticed?
> **Roll:** 97
> **Outcome:** Extreme No
> **Random Event:** None

The corridor ends at an entrance way. The feeble light of a torch illuminates what seems to be some kind of storeroom. The room is filled with piles of rotting cloth that may have once been funeral robes or similar. Planks of wood lean up against the wall and in the corner is a crooked table. There seems to be something lying on the table, some sort of parchment or documents. At the far end are two doorways, both dark and forbidding.

Okan crosses quickly over to the table and examines the parchments. They seem to be some kind of maps with written notes over them. 

"Kaapo - what do you make of these?" He beckons the young man over. Sakari moves towards the two doorways, his war axe held ready.

> [!roll] Test - Kaapo understand the parchments
> **Result:** 5

Kaapo bends to examine the drawings and writing. He leafs through the parchments carefully.

"These seem to be plans of some sort. There are references here to ancient events or artifacts although the text makes little sense."

> [!roll] Test - Sakari sense danger
> **Result:** 2

Sakari stands, his ears straining to hear anything from the tunnels but there's nothing. He looks around, examining the rest of the room. One area of the cloths has been flattened as if by a body lying on them. Sakari sniffs tentatively at the flattened cloths.

> [!roll] Test - Sense familiar smells
> **Result:** 6

He recognises a faint scent on the cloth as the same scent he smelt in the tavern when they were attacked by the shadow creature.

"That shadow creature has been here. This is it's lair I think."

> [!roll] Test - Find blood or other signs the creature is here.
> **Result:** 5

Sakari turns over the cloths with one tentative foot. There are blood stains on the cloth.
