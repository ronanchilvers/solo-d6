The stair is dark and as they descend the darkness deepens. Sakari stops, his huge form just visible in the gloom. 

"We need light - Kaapo, anything you can do?"

The young mage whispers back - "Hold on. Let me try." Sakari and Okan hear a faint mumbling and muttering.

> [!roll] Test - Kaapo to create a small light
> **Result:** 6

A small orb of light glimmers faintly in the darkness and then brightens a little, allowing them to see the stairway. It floats forward just ahead of Sakari who nods - "Good work." He turns and begins to cautiously descend again.

The staircase leads downwards for 30 or 40 steps. At the bottom they find themselves in a narrow corridor.
