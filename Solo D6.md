# Adventure seed

An artifact has been stolen from a merchant in the Trade Ward. They have two leads:

- A sack made from the skin of some unknown creature
- A small wooden box (with a secret compartment)

These were found after the robbery took place. Their employer, a human merchant named [[Lina Devdan]] asked to meet them to discuss the matter.
