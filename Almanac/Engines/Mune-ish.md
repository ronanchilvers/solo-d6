# Oracle

Likely: `dice: 2d6kh`
50/50: `dice: 1d6`
Unlikely: `dice: 2d6dh`
Event: 1 on d6 causes an event - `dice: 1d6`

| Roll | Result  |
| ---- | ------- |
| 1    | No and  |
| 2    | No      |
| 3    | No but  |
| 4    | Yes but |
| 5    | Yes     |
| 6    | Yes and |

## Scene Modification

At the start of a scene, roll the Event die to see if a scene proceeds as expected. If an event is indicated, roll 1d6 (`dice: 1d6`) to find out how - a result of 3 or less indicates the scene is altered while 4 or more indicates the scene is interrupted. Use the oracle to work out how the scene is changed.

# Events

| 2    | Entity positive |
| 3    | Entity negative |
| 4    | Advance thread  |
| 5    | Regress thread  |
| 6    | Wild            |
