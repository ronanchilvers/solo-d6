Cloak Wood, also stylized as Cloakwood, was an ancient, thickly grown forest in the Western Heartlands region on the south end of the Sword Coast.[1]

## Description
The sages of nearby Candlekeep asserted that Cloak Wood contained portals to several other parts of the cosmos.[2] Though they were uncertain of the exact number of portals within it.[3] As of 1479 DR, however, these portals were believed to be defunct.[2]

## Geography

This forest was located south of the city of Baldur's Gate.[3] To the southwest from the Cloak Wood laid Cape Raeth, a small sparsely-populated peninsula that formed Cloak Bay and a smaller Borlyth Bay.[4]

## Geographical Features
Unlike the cliffs to the north, Cloak Wood's shoreline theoretically allowed a ship to moor and send a small boat to shore for water and supplies.[5] In practice, only desperate mariners dared to face the wood's dangerous wildlife.[6]

## Flora & Fauna
Cloak Wood was known to be full of beasts, monsters, and vicious fey, causing most folks to avoid the forest. These creatures included giant spiders, korreds,[6] kampfults,[3] quicklings, satyrs, stirges, and other uncommon creatures.[3][6]

Trees that grew within this forest included hangman trees,[6] beeches, elms, felsul, and hiexel.[3]

## History
The mines of Cloak Wood flooded in the Year of the Blue Dragon, 1243 DR, tragically killing many of the dwarves that dwelled within. They were later taken over by the mercantile consortium of the Iron Throne and continued mining operations until they were flooded again in the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR by a group of adventurers led by Abdel Adrian.[7]

## Inhabitants
Circa the midâ€“14th century DR the Cloak Wood served as the home to a circle of druids led by Archdruid Seniyad. This group acted in direct opposition to the Shadow Druids, a group that was led by Amarande and his devotees.[7] The Druids loyal to Seniyad remained within the forest well into the late 15th century DR.[8]

Around that same time, the forest was also home to the goblin army known as the Red Fang Marauders.[9]

## Notable Locations
