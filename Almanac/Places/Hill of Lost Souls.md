![[Hill_of_Lost_Souls.webp]]
The Hill of Lost Souls was a lone mountain that stood in the middle of Pelleor's Prairie in the Backlands of the Western Heartlands. The Hill was a long-dormant volcano that had been weathered and softened over the years into a gently sloped mountain with a shallow crater. Between outcroppings of lava rock and obsidian, the Hill was covered in soft grass and bleached bones. Occasional tremors and geysers were the only evidence of continued volcanic activity.

The area was haunted by the ghosts of human, goblin, and orc soldiers who died during the Battle of Bones, all seemingly seeking a way to finally find eternal rest. They referred to themselves as "the Fallen."
