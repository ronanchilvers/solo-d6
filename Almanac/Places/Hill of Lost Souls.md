![[Hill_of_Lost_Souls.webp]]
The Hill of Lost Souls was a lone mountain that stood in the middle of Pelleor's Prairie in the Backlands of the Western Heartlands. The Hill was a long-dormant volcano that had been weathered and softened over the years into a gently sloped mountain with a shallow crater. Between outcroppings of lava rock and obsidian, the Hill was covered in soft grass and bleached bones. Occasional tremors and geysers were the only evidence of continued volcanic activity.

The area was haunted by the ghosts of human, goblin, and orc soldiers who died during the Battle of Bones, all seemingly seeking a way to finally find eternal rest. They referred to themselves as "the Fallen." It was said that those who slept on the Hill ran the risk of being spirited into a vision of a ghostly battle between humans and goblins, especially if they rested there on Lost Souls Eve. Those who returned from this vision might bear a scar in the shape of the heraldry of the spirits alongside whom they were forced to fight. Experiences along these lines were had by both a local druid named Tharnn Greenwinter and the adventuring group known as the Seekers.

Some dwarves believed that there were massive gem-filled tunnels beneath the Hill.

## Notable Locations
- A mysterious geyser just west of the hill vented about once a tenday with extraordinary force.
- An outcropping of rock on the western face of the Hill was notable for its resemblance to a lion's head.
- Tomb of Thelarn, a dwarf-made tomb of Thelarn Swifthammer rumored to contain his legendary axe, Skysplitter.

## Inhabitants
Goblins and orcs were known to make pilgrimages to the Hill of Lost Souls, particularly to the sites where the human armies were thought to have camped. These sometimes included ceremonies in which the spirits of goblinoids and orcs slain in the Battle of Bones were summoned to reenact the battle alongside the living. The shrieks and hollers from these events could be heard across the prairie.

A tribe of hill giants lived on the rocky eastern side of the Hill. They were largely disinterested in attacking humanoids unless antagonized, and instead concentrated their efforts on launching attacks on a closely-related tribe in the Battle of Bones region. Their goal appeared to be to "free" their kin from the influence of an undead fire giant who had come to rule over them, and they would launch attacks across the grassland to do battle.

Below ground, the Hill was home to firenewts who lived in tunnels that extended beneath the surrounding plains. These passages were warmed by natural volcanic heat and were made of tempered stone reinforced with support beams.
