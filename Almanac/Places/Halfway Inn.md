The Halfway Inn was a tavern and inn located in the mountains near Evereska that was constructed for the elves to trade with the other races. It was located on the northwestern border of Evereska, a ride of an hour or two away from the city of Evereska. The proprietor in 1361 DR was named Myrin Silverspear.

The inn had an associated stable. The front of the stable opened up on to a busy, well-lit street. The back door opened up to a path that led into the forest behind the inn. It sold a variety of elven spirits known as Elquesstria.
