The Misty Forest was located just west of the High Moor, and south of the river Delimbiyr.[1]

## Description
The Misty Forest was a fog-filled, rainy forest, west of the High Moor, that was also an elven kingdom.[2]

## Geography
### Flora and Fauna
The Misty Forest was full of pine trees and other types of evergreen trees.[3] The northern part of the forest was dominated by spruce trees though.[4]

Red deer were common in the forest, and rarely left the confines of the trees except in summer.[5] Bears, boars, and wild cows could also be encountered in the woods.[5] Owlbears lived there too.[6]

## Society
### Religion
Sites of power sacred to Eilistraee dating back to Miyeritar could be found within the forest.[7]
A pool, sacred to Eldath, led to her realm of True Grove before the Time of Troubles. Eldathyn still believed that it was possible to access said realm via that pool.[8]
Shrines to Eilistraee,[7] Eldath, Mielikki, and Silvanus were scattered throughout the entire forest.[9]
A temple to Chauntea, maintained by druids, could also be found in the forest.[10]

## Government
As of 1489 DR, the Misty Forest was ruled over by King Melandrach, known as the 'King of the Woods'. He had ruled the forest for at least 150 years by this point,[11] and maintained that his realm was one that belonged exclusively to the elves.[2]

### Foreign Relations
In 1363 DR, in the wake of a devastating war with Baatezu, the elves of the High Forest sent a charismatic advisor named Eamond Blackmantle to act as the Misty Forest's Speaker (a figurehead/arbitrator/ambassador). Eamond almost singlehandedly turned the Misty Forest around from a war-ravaged ruin to the biggest settlement of wild elves west of the Inner Sea by first organizing the rebuilding effort, then attracting elves to immigrate from other places and opening trade with outsiders.[12]

## Trade
The elves of the Misty Forest kept bees, and did a brisk trade in mead and honey wine with merchants who passed through The Way Inn, trading for anything that they couldn't make themselves.[12]

## Defenses
In the late 14th century, the forest was protected not only by the elves, but also by a druid who had become so detached from civilization that she'd given up her name.[5]

## History
During the Crown Wars, the Misty Forest was part of the elven realm of Miyeritar.[13]

The elves of the forest were involved in the Second Dragonspear War, but by the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR, had rebuilt all that they had lost in that war.[12]

In 1372 DR, Kyleena Moonglow's tribe of Chultan wild elves settled in the Misty Forest, after failed attempt to take over the Lonely Barrens and threatening the local farmers with famine.[14]

During the Tyranny of Dragons, King Melandrach was chosen to represent both his own realm and the elves of the High Forest, at the Council of Waterdeep, where it was discovered that not only was his younger son, Neronvain - who was long thought dead - still alive, but that Neronvain was also the Cult of the Dragon's green Wyrmspeaker, terrorizing the Misty Forest's inhabitants.[11]

## Inhabitants
Rangers were known to patrol the area, and several druids had groves in the forest. A small community of wild elves dwelt somewhere within the forest.[3] Wood elves were also known to live in the forest, as were hybsils.[15] Deer lived in the Misty Forest.[16]

Barbarians from the High Moor used the Misty forest as a source of food and wood, and the orcs of the High Moor used it as a place to hide and strike travelers and caravans on the Trade Way.[3]
