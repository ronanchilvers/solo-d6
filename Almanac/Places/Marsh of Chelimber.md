![[Najara - Marsh of Chelimber.webp]]
The Marsh of Chelimber used to be home to an entire human kingdom. When the kingdom was drowned, its people became undead soldiers. Lizardfolk began to inhabit the marshlands and became masters of the undead. The various temples within the marsh housed minotaurs, allies of the lizardfolk who guarded the pathway to the Betrayer with the aid of bulettes.
