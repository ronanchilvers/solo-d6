![[Evereska.jpg]]
Evereska (pronounced: /ɛvɛrˈɛskɑː/ eh-ver-EH-ska, Elvish for "fortress home") was a secreted city within a fabled valley in the Western Heartlands, one of the last realms of the elves in the North. Founded in secret during the Founding Time, Evereska became a haven for the remaining Fair Folk in Faerûn following the Retreat, during the early years of the Era of Upheaval. It was the epitome of elven culture and beauty, and nearly no outsiders were considered welcome within.

> [!quote] Aedyn Graymantle, wilderness guide and ranger of Evereska.
> When I rest at the end of the day and retreat into reverie...I recall the Evereska I wandered as a youth, when I followed a haunting song or a wisp of light among the roiling fogs of the Greycloaks, picked sweet berries in the hollows of the hills, and swam in the cold streams that flowed out of their heights.

Houses in Evereska were worked into the landscape and it was possible to float large items in the city. Blueleaf trees covered the valley and were sculpted by magic. Weather conditions and diseases were regulated by the city's magical mythal, a semi-sentient magical creation that protected the city and residents, granting them better quality of life in myriad ways.

Admittance into Evereska was only available by means of the Passing, a passageway that required a specific password or invitation from the Hill Elders to bypass peacefully. The city could only be accessed by a select few well-protected tunnels or by direct accent up its steep cliff face.
