![[Fort-Morninglord.png]]
Fort Morninglord was a keep in Elturgard in the Western Heartlands, located a day's ride from Elturel and looking over the River Chionthar.

In the Year of the Fifth Circle, 1476 DR, the entire garrison of paladins disappeared overnight and every stone in the fort was blackened and every door and window fused shut. The High Observer of Elturgard, Thavius Kreeg, feared the fort was contaminated by some unknown evil and ordered it sealed and furthermore declared that anyone entering the fort would be outlawed. All entrances were bricked up behind layers of stone and mortar, and thus it remained by 1489 DR.

Meanwhile, the new garrison maintained a fortified encampment close by. The paladins of the Order of the Companion used it as a base from which to patrol the surrounding land, and guarded Fort Morninglord against curious trespassers and adventurers.
