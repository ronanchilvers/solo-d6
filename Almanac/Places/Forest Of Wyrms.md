![[Forest_of_Wyrms.jpg]]
The Forest of Wyrms, known as Ss'kowlyn'raa by the yuan-ti, was a dark and dangerous forest found in the Western Heartlands. The air in the forest was cool and damp, and mists covered some areas of the ground.

The Forest of Wyrms was located between the Serpent Hills and the Trielta Hills, just south of the Winding Water river.

It contained many pines and tall redwood trees, some with trunks more than 20ft (6.1m) in diameter. There was not much vegetation on the forest floor and the terrain was mostly smooth. Helmthorn brush grew dense in the forest.

Befitting its name, the forest was home to great many species of poisonous and constrictor snakes.

## Notable Locations
- Lyran's Hold was a warded tower created by the wizard Lyran.
- Ss'thar'tiss'ssun, one of the most ancient set of ruins in all the Realms.
- Thlohtzin, the former fortress of a lich that was then taken over by yuan-ti.
- The lair of Tharas'kalagram, a red dragon that lived in a small volcano.

## Inhabitants
The forest's name was derived from the population of green dragons who inhabited the eastern side of the forest. They tended not to stray too close to the western side because of the proximity of Soubar and the likelihood of encountering adventurers nearby, but some younger or bolder dragons were found in this area. Dragon slayers ventured into the forest to hunt these great beasts, and members of the Dragon Cult often traveled within to court then.

Terrific and dangerous creatures were also known to lair within the forest, including giant rhinoceros beetle, hill giants, sword spiders, stirges, behirs, hydras, and wyverns.

### Notable Inhabitants
- Agyrtclughwaur, the green wyrm.
- Rylatar'ralah'tyma, the mature female red dragon.
- Morentherene, the green dragon half-sister of the half-dragon Ziatar.
- Terpenzi, a great dark naga that led a population of ophidians in the forest circa the fall of Netheril.
