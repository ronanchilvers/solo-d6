The Tor of Swords was a granite upcropping on Pelleor's Praire in the Western Heartlands. The abbey of Endar Aglandtor, dedicated to the dwarven deity Haela Brightaxe, was dug into a series of caverns at the base of the Tor.

The Tor of Swords once marked the northern border of the Helbryn, the hunting preserve of the ancient dwarven kingdom of Oghrann (which rose in −5125 DR and fell in −3770 DR).

At some point before the Year of Sunrise, 1 DR, a quintet of magical swords associated with the Netherese successor realm of Anauria was entombed within the hill, hence the name Tor of Swords.

In time, adherents of Haela Brightaxe dug out the abbey of Endar Aglandtor at the base of the Tor of Swords, which became the headquarters of the militant religious order known as Haela's Host. Wielding the Tor's fabled Anaurian blades, the swordswomen of the Host kept the monstrous population of the nearby area in check.
