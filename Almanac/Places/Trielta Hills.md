![[Trielta_Hills.jpg]]
The Trielta Hills lay to the north-east of Triel and north-west of Hardbuckler in the Western Heartlands. They were home to many communities of gnomes and a few halflings. Periodically, miners found silver and gold deposits in the hills. This led to inevitable small gold rushes, but the strikes didn't last long.  There were no rumors of lost kingdoms, wizards towers, ruined holds or any such thing about the Trielta Hills, making them almost unique for their normality.
