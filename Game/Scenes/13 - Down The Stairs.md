> [!scene] The characters make their way down the stairs to discover what lies beneath the mausoleum
> **Weather:** Fair
> **Location:** City Of The Dead, Waterdeep
> **Chaos Factor:** 5
> **Scene Type:** Altered

The stair is dark and as they descend the darkness deepens. Sakari stops, his huge form just visible in the gloom. 

"We need light - Kaapo, anything you can do?"

The young mage whispers back - "Hold on. Let me try." Sakari and Okan hear a faint mumbling and muttering.

> [!roll] Test - Kaapo to create a small light
> **Result:** 6

A small orb of light glimmers faintly in the darkness and then brightens a little, allowing them to see the stairway. It floats forward just ahead of Sakari who nods - "Good work." He turns and begins to cautiously descend again. The staircase leads downwards for 30 or 40 steps. At the bottom they find themselves in a narrow corridor. Kaapo sends the glowing light ahead of them a little way.

> [!roll] Test - Stealth roll
> **Result:** 4

They creep forward down the corridor the light gleaming palely in the darkness. They've not gone far when they see ahead of them a glimmer of torchlight.

> [!oracle] Are they noticed?
> **Roll:** 97
> **Outcome:** Extreme No
> **Random Event:** None

The corridor ends at an entrance way. The feeble light of a torch illuminates what seems to be some kind of storeroom. The room is filled with piles of rotting cloth that may have once been funeral robes or similar. Planks of wood lean up against the wall and in the corner is a crooked table. There seems to be something lying on the table, some sort of parchment or documents. At the far end are two doorways, both dark and forbidding.

Okan crosses quickly over to the table and examines the parchments. They seem to be some kind of maps with written notes over them. 

"Kaapo - what do you make of these?" He beckons the young man over. Sakari moves towards the two doorways, his war axe held ready.

> [!roll] Test - Kaapo understand the parchments
> **Result:** 5

Kaapo bends to examine the drawings and writing. He leafs through the parchments carefully.

"These seem to be plans of some sort. There are references here to ancient events or artifacts although the text makes little sense."

> [!roll] Test - Sakari sense danger
> **Result:** 2

Sakari stands, his ears straining to hear anything from the tunnels but there's nothing. He looks around, examining the rest of the room. One area of the cloths has been flattened as if by a body lying on them. Sakari sniffs tentatively at the flattened cloths.

> [!roll] Test - Sense familiar smells
> **Result:** 6

He recognises a faint scent on the cloth as the same scent he smelt in the tavern when they were attacked by the shadow creature.

"That shadow creature has been here. This is it's lair I think."

> [!roll] Test - Find blood or other signs the creature is here.
> **Result:** 5

Sakari turns over the cloths with one tentative foot. There are blood stains on the cloth. Kaapo grabs the parchments and stuffs them into his bag. "Lair? Don't like the sound of that. Let's go!" His whisper is a little shrill.

Okan shakes his head - "I want to know what's going on down here. Besides - I want to know who that was who came in here AND we have unfinished business with that big cat. I want to introduce it to Sakari!" The big kahru chuckles, a noise somewhere between a growl and a laugh. Okan turns to the two doorways - "Which one do you think?" He steps towards the nearest and cocks his head to listen.

> [!oracle] Does he hear anything?
> **Roll:** 54
> **Outcome:** No
> **Random Event:** None

He sniffs, testing the air.

> [!roll] Test - Check for traps
> **Result:** 5

> [!oracle] Are there any traps?
> **Roll:** 60
> **Outcome:** No
> **Random Event:** None

Okan gives a small murmur of consideration before stepping over to the other doorway. Again he listens.

> [!oracle] Does he hear anything?
> **Roll:** 94
> **Outcome:** No
> **Random Event:** None

Again there is nothing but the slight drip of water somewhere in the darkness. He peers into the gloom, checking the walls and arch of the door.

> [!roll] Test - Check for traps
> **Result:** 5

> [!oracle] Is there a trap?
> **Roll:** 62
> **Outcome:** No
> **Random Event:** None

He steps back. "Not much to choose between them. I've always liked left - let's go left." He steps forward into the left hand doorway and they begin to cautiously edge along the tunnel. After a few steps Okan halts and whispers - "Wait! It's blocked - there's a gate."

> [!roll] Test - Detect traps
> **Result:** 6

His tone becomes urgent - "There's something wrong here. Go back - carefully!" He edges away from the gate and as he does so a thin swirl of gaseous mist ebbs out around it. He throws his arm across his face - "Back back back!!"

They emerge back into the previous room again. Sakari nods at the other doorway - "That one then?" - Kaapo says - "Maybe I could stay here? I mean we don't all need to go down there... do we?" 

Okan gives Kaapo a 'look' - "What about your little light? We'll need it! You follow behind us." - He turns to Sakari - "Saki - I think it might be a good idea if you led the way - just in case that cat thing decides it wants to play!?" Sakari nods and steps forwards into the tunnel, his huge frame almost filling it. Kaapo's light flits ahead of them.

> [!roll] Test - Stealth
> **Result:** 6

Sakari pads down the tunnel, his movements silent despite his huge frame. Okan follows behind. The tunnel twists and after a few moments they see a dim light round a corner ahead of them. Okan whispers - "Kaapo - douse that light." The floating orb immediately winks out, leaving them momentarily in blackness. As their eyes grow accustomed to the dark, the dim glimmer of torchlight is discernible again.

> [!roll] Test - Sakari listens for noise
> **Result:** 6

> [!oracle] Can he hear the lynx?
> **Roll:** 60
> **Outcome:** Yes
> **Random Event:** None

> [!oracle] Does he hear whimpering?
> **Roll:** 22
> **Outcome:** Yes
> **Random Event:** PC Negative, Relinquish Riches / Officially Rotten, 

Sakari holds up a paw - "Listen!". A sound comes to them down the tunnel, a thin whimper, as of a wounded animal. Then there is silence. Sakari edges forwards along the tunnel towards the source of light, Okan behind him. Kaapo stays back a little. Sakari reaches the end of the tunnel. He holds a paw up to Okan indicating he should stay back and then carefully and slowly inches forward so he can see into the room.

The room is roughly square, with a raised dais in the centre on which is a low altar. Two torches in brackets are on the walls, casting some light across the room. The huge creature from the tavern is lying to one side of the cavern.

> [!oracle] Are there more lynx?
> **Roll:** 36
> **Outcome:** Yes
> **Random Event:** None

Another of the creatures again is pacing slowly around the edge of the dais. The figure that they saw enter the building is crouched by the side of the first creature, seeming to tend it's wounds. Sakari can see the scorch marks on its fur, caused by Kaapo's spell. As he watches from the shadows, the figure strokes the head of the injured creature. He wonders if they are doing some sort of healing magic.

> [!oracle] Are they?
> **Roll:** 41 (unlikely)
> **Outcome:** No
> **Random Event:** None

The creature lets its great head drop again to its paws which are stretched out in front. Sakari watches the figure stand and step over towards the dais. It mounts the step and stands before the altar.

Sakari eases back from the tunnel entrance and indicates silently to the others.

> [!oracle] Do the lynx hear something?
> **Roll:** 56 (very likely)
> **Outcome:** Yes
> **Random Event:** None

As Sakari turns back, in a frenzy of roaring, claws and teeth, a lynx explodes from the glom of the room and leaps at Sakari. He just has time to yell - "There are three of them!" - before he is bourne to the ground.

> [!roll] Evade - Sakari attempts to twist out of the way
> **Result:** 3

Sakari twists, trying to avoid the claws and teeth of the lynx but the creature has the drop on him. 

> [!roll] Attack - Lynx claws Sakari
> **Result:** 5

Claws rake his side and he grunts in pain, blood welling from the wound.

> [!abstract] Initiative

Sakari roars and grabbing the creature's forelimbs, attempts to throw it off.

> [!roll] Test - Sakari hurl the lynx aside
> **Result:** 6

The lynx is slammed against the wall of the tunnel. It yelps in pain. Sakari whips his axe round and smashes it into the creature's side.

> [!roll] Attack - Sakari axes the lynx
> **Result:** 5

The axe bites deep into the creatures flank and it bellows in pain but as it does so, Okan hurls his dagger at it.

> [!roll] Attack - Okan throws his dagger
> **Result:** 6

> [!roll] Evade - The lynx twists and blurs to evade the attack
> **Result:** 2

The blade slashes a long gash in the creature's hide and it roars again in pain. Okan, pulls his bow from his back and nocks an arrow.

Behind the first creature the other two lynx have bounded to the tunnel entrance and are scrabbling to pass the first one and attack.

> [!roll] Attack - Lynx claws Sakari
> **Result:** 6

> [!roll] Attack - Lynx tries to bite Sakari
> **Result:** 6

The lynx slashes at Sakari with its claws, wrenching him forward and biting down on his arm. Sakari yells in pain. Behind it the other two lynx are trying to push past but can't fit into the tunnel.

> [!roll] Attack - Kaapo attacks lynx
> **Result:** 6

> [!roll] Attack - Kaapo attacks lynx again
> **Result:** 5

Kaapo's voice is shrill as his shrieks words of magic. Twin bolts of fire shoot past Okan and Sakari. There is a smell of sizzling hair and hide as they scorch the creature. It roars and howls in pain, spitting and hissing, dark shadows coiling around it.

> [!roll] Attack - Sakari axes the lynx
> **Result:** 6

Sakari swings his axe as the lynx twists to escape. The war axe cuts straight through the creatures neck, blood spraying across the wall as it crashes into the stone floor, dead. The other two creatures stand just inside the room growling, teeth bared, ready to spring. Sakari roars at them - "Come on! Come and taste my steel!"

> [!oracle] Is the figure still in the room?
> **Roll:** 98 (Very unlikelly)
> **Outcome:** Extreme no
> **Random Event:** None

The two lynx slowly back away, one of them limping a little as it moves. They are snarling, shadows wreathing around them. Sakari steps over the corpse of the lynx, his axe in his hands. He slowly moves out into the room, his eyes watching both creatures, waiting for them to move. Behind him Okan edges forwards and Kaapo moves to stand at the tunnel entrance, his hands poised to cast a spell.

> [!oracle] Did the figure set a trap?
> **Roll:** 24 (Very likely)
> **Outcome:** Yes
> **Random Event:** None

> [!roll] Test - Okan detect traps
> **Result:** 5

Okan mutters - "Careful Saki - I think there's something else prepared for our arrival here as well as these overgrown pussy cats!"

> [!oracle] Is there a pressure trap somewhere on the floor?
> **Roll:** 63 (Very likely)
> **Outcome:** Yes
> **Random Event:** None

The two lynx spring forward and Sakari roars, swinging his axe to meet them.

> [!abstract] Initiative

Sakari leaps towards the lynx as they rush forwards, his axe swinging in a wide arc.

> [!roll] Attack - Sakari hacks at a lynx
> **Result:** 6

The creature howls in pain as Sakari's blade slashes it. As it tumbles backwards Sakari can see that the animal is wounded. Sakari's voice is harsh and triumphant as he yells - "This is the creature from the tavern! I see your handiwork in its hide Okan!!"

> [!oracle] Does Sakari step on the trap?
> **Roll:** 14 (Unlikely)
> **Outcome:** Yes
> **Random Event:** None

As he steps back to prepare his next blow, there is an audible grating sound from one of the flagstones beneath his feet. The stone shifts and for a moment Sakari wobbles on the spot. Okan yells - "You've triggered the trap! Run!!"

At the same time Okan sends two arrows flashing towards the two lynx.

> [!roll] Attack - Okan shoots at the lynx
> **Result:** 6

The first arrow buries itself in the side of the already wounded animal. It shrieks and howls in pain, staggering backwards before falling onto its side, dead.

> [!roll] Attack - Okan fires his second arrow
> **Result:** 4

The arrow whistles towards the uninjured creature but it leaps aside and lunges forward towards Sakari, roaring.

> [!roll] Attack - Lynx attacks Sakari
> **Result:** 6

Sakari's foot slips in the moving flagstone and the creature's claws rake his arm. The creature's jaws open wide to bite.

> [!roll] Attack - Lynx bites Sakari
> **Result:** 3

Sakari manages to twist out of the way, roaring in pain, avoiding the cruel fangs of the beast.

> [!roll] Attack - Kaapo shoots fire bolt at the lynx
> **Result:** 4

Suddenly a bolt of fiery energy shoots from the shadow of the tunnel as Kaapo hurls his magic at the lynx. It just misses, burning a furrow in the creature's fur but doing no other damage. A second bolt flashes towards it.

> [!roll] Attack - Kaapo shoots another fire bolt at the lynx
> **Result:** 5

While the lynx was agile enough to avoid the first, the second bolt of energy catches it in the side. It howls in pain.

> [!oracle] Is the trap a water trap?
> **Roll:** 81
> **Outcome:** No
> **Random Event:** None

> [!oracle] What is the nature of the trap?
> **Roll:** 66,66
> **Outcome:** Oppose Pain
> **Random Event:** None

As Sakari brings his axe back and tenses to leap at the lynx, a greenish gas begins to flow from the walls, puddle at the bottom and then starts to almost ooze across the floor towards them. Okan shouts - "We need to go!! Now!! Don't let that stuff touch you!"

Sakari jumps backwards, away from the slowly spreading pool of gaseous smoke.

> [!oracle] Does the lynx continue the attack?
> **Roll:** 53 (Unlikely)
> **Outcome:** No
> **Random Event:** None

The lynx backs off, snarling as Sakari edges away and then leaps for the tunnel entrance. Sakari is bleeding freely from his wounds but seems undaunted. They scramble through the tunnel into the far room. Kaapo is heading for the stairs when Okan shouts - "Wait! Where did that figure go? Who was it?"

> [!roll] Test - Did the PCs notice anything about the figure?
> **Result:** 4

Sakari says - "I was too busy with those big pussy cats! Kaapo - you see anything?" - Kaapo shakes his head - "There's one of those pussy cats still very much alive! What do we do?" - Okan says - "Can you do something with that tunnel? Stop the gas or whatever it is coming out here?" - "I'll try..."

Kaapo frowns and drops his bag. Stepping forwards he concentrates on the tunnel entrance, holding his hands up towards it.

> [!roll] Test - Kaapo cast a spell to temporarily block the entrance
> **Result:** 6

The air in the tunnel entrance shimmers and for a moment becomes opaque. Then it slowly fades until it seems a light mist is clouding the tunnel. Kaapo relaxes, breathing hard. 

"Won't last for long but that should stop it for the moment."

They slump down, watching as the greenish gas flows up the tunnel towards them and then washes up against Kaapo's barrier which shimmers and glitters in response. Kaapo kneels besides Sakari - "Let me look at that arm of yours."

> [!roll] Test - Kaapo heals Sakari
> **Result:** 6 (critical)
> Heal 3 HP

Kaapo stems the flow of blood and binds Sakari's arm tightly. He concentrates for a moment and a faint bluish glow spreads along the wound. Once he's done, the kahru flexes his muscles - "Much better. Thanks Kaapo."

They watch as the gas slowly subsides. After around 10 minutes, Kaapo's barrier glitters, pulses and fades away. "That's it I'm afraid. Hopefully that stuff has gone!" - The young mage's voice is a little nervous.

> [!oracle] Has the gas gone?
> **Roll:** 44 (Nearly certain)
> **Outcome:** Yes
> **Random Event:** New NPC

Okan tentatively steps forward and waves a piece of wood (found in a pile in the corner of the room) in the tunnel entrance. He has his arm across his face as he does so.

"Careful Okan - don't want to have to pull you out in bits!" - Sakari's voice is a low growl

Okan steps slowly forwards. The last of the gas is dispersing now and he can see through to the far room.
