> [!scene] The characters make their way down the stairs to discover what lies beneath the mausoleum
> **Weather:** Fair
> **Location:** City Of The Dead, Waterdeep
> **Chaos Factor:** 5
> **Scene Type:** Altered

The stair is dark and as they descend the darkness deepens. Sakari stops, his huge form just visible in the gloom. 

"We need light - Kaapo, anything you can do?"

The young mage whispers back - "Hold on. Let me try." Sakari and Okan hear a faint mumbling and muttering.

> [!roll] Test - Kaapo to create a small light
> **Result:** 6

A small orb of light glimmers faintly in the darkness and then brightens a little, allowing them to see the stairway. It floats forward just ahead of Sakari who nods - "Good work." He turns and begins to cautiously descend again. The staircase leads downwards for 30 or 40 steps. At the bottom they find themselves in a narrow corridor. Kaapo sends the glowing light ahead of them a little way.

> [!roll] Test - Stealth roll
> **Result:** 4

They creep forward down the corridor the light gleaming palely in the darkness. They've not gone far when they see ahead of them a glimmer of torchlight.

> [!oracle] Are they noticed?
> **Roll:** 97
> **Outcome:** Extreme No
> **Random Event:** None

The corridor ends at an entrance way. The feeble light of a torch illuminates what seems to be some kind of storeroom. The room is filled with piles of rotting cloth that may have once been funeral robes or similar. Planks of wood lean up against the wall and in the corner is a crooked table. There seems to be something lying on the table, some sort of parchment or documents. At the far end are two doorways, both dark and forbidding.

Okan crosses quickly over to the table and examines the parchments. They seem to be some kind of maps with written notes over them. 

"Kaapo - what do you make of these?" He beckons the young man over. Sakari moves towards the two doorways, his war axe held ready.

> [!roll] Test - Kaapo understand the parchments
> **Result:** 5

Kaapo bends to examine the drawings and writing. He leafs through the parchments carefully.

"These seem to be plans of some sort. There are references here to ancient events or artifacts although the text makes little sense."

> [!roll] Test - Sakari sense danger
> **Result:** 2

Sakari stands, his ears straining to hear anything from the tunnels but there's nothing. He looks around, examining the rest of the room. One area of the cloths has been flattened as if by a body lying on them. Sakari sniffs tentatively at the flattened cloths.

> [!roll] Test - Sense familiar smells
> **Result:** 6

He recognises a faint scent on the cloth as the same scent he smelt in the tavern when they were attacked by the shadow creature.

"That shadow creature has been here. This is it's lair I think."

> [!roll] Test - Find blood or other signs the creature is here.
> **Result:** 5

Sakari turns over the cloths with one tentative foot. There are blood stains on the cloth. Kaapo grabs the parchments and stuffs them into his bag. "Lair? Don't like the sound of that. Let's go!" His whisper is a little shrill.

Okan shakes his head - "I want to know what's going on down here. Besides - I want to know who that was who came in here AND we have unfinished business with that big cat. I want to introduce it to Sakari!" The big kahru chuckles, a noise somewhere between a growl and a laugh. Okan turns to the two doorways - "Which one do you think?" He steps towards the nearest and cocks his head to listen.

> [!oracle] Does he hear anything?
> **Roll:** 54
> **Outcome:** No
> **Random Event:** None

He sniffs, testing the air.

> [!roll] Test - Check for traps
> **Result:** 5

> [!oracle] Are there any traps?
> **Roll:** 60
> **Outcome:** No
> **Random Event:** None

Okan gives a small murmur of consideration before stepping over to the other doorway. Again he listens.

> [!oracle] Does he hear anything?
> **Roll:** 94
> **Outcome:** No
> **Random Event:** None

Again there is nothing but the slight drip of water somewhere in the darkness. He peers into the gloom, checking the walls and arch of the door.

> [!roll] Test - Check for traps
> **Result:** 5

> [!oracle] Is there a trap?
> **Roll:** 62
> **Outcome:** No
> **Random Event:** None

He steps back. "Not much to choose between them. I've always liked left - let's go left." He steps forward into the left hand doorway and they begin to cautiously edge along the tunnel. After a few steps Okan halts and whispers - "Wait! It's blocked - there's a gate."

> [!roll] Test - Detect traps
> **Result:** 6

His tone becomes urgent - "There's something wrong here. Go back - carefully!" He edges away from the gate and as he does so a thin swirl of gaseous mist ebbs out around it. He throws his arm across his face - "Back back back!!"

They emerge back into the previous room again. Sakari nods at the other doorway - "That one then?" - Kaapo says - "Maybe I could stay here? I mean we don't all need to go down there... do we?" 

Okan gives Kaapo a 'look' - "What about your little light? We'll need it! You follow behind us." - He turns to Sakari - "Saki - I think it might be a good idea if you led the way - just in case that cat thing decides it wants to play!?" Sakari nods and steps forwards into the tunnel, his huge frame almost filling it. Kaapo's light flits ahead of them.

> [!roll] Test - Stealth
> **Result:** 6

Sakari pads down the tunnel, his movements silent despite his huge frame. Okan follows behind. The tunnel twists and after a few moments they see a dim light round a corner ahead of them. Okan whispers - "Kaapo - douse that light." The floating orb immediately winks out, leaving them momentarily in blackness. As their eyes grow accustomed to the dark, the dim glimmer of torchlight is discernible again.

> [!roll] Test - Sakari listens for noise
> **Result:** 6

> [!oracle] Can he hear the lynx?
> **Roll:** 60
> **Outcome:** Yes
> **Random Event:** None

> [!oracle] Does he hear whimpering?
> **Roll:** 22
> **Outcome:** Yes
> **Random Event:** PC Negative, Relinquish Riches / Officially Rotten, 

Sakari holds up a paw - "Listen!". A sound comes to them down the tunnel, a thin whimper, as of a wounded animal. Then there is silence. Sakari edges forwards along the tunnel towards the source of light, Okan behind him. Kaapo stays back a little. Sakari reaches the end of the tunnel. He holds a paw up to Okan indicating he should stay back and then carefully and slowly inches forward so he can see into the room.

The room is roughly square, with a raised dais in the centre on which is a low altar. Two torches in brackets are on the walls, casting some light across the room. The huge creature from the tavern is lying to one side of the cavern.

> [!oracle] Are there more lynx?
> **Roll:** 36
> **Outcome:** Yes
> **Random Event:** None

Another of the creatures again is pacing slowly around the edge of the dais. The figure that they saw enter the building is crouched by the side of the first creature, seeming to tend it's wounds. Sakari can see the scorch marks on its fur, caused by Kaapo's spell. As he watches from the shadows, the figure strokes the head of the injured creature. He wonders if they are doing some sort of healing magic.

> [!oracle] Are they?
> **Roll:** 41 (unlikely)
> **Outcome:** No
> **Random Event:** None

The creature let's it's great head drop again to it's paws which are stretched out in front. Sakari watches the figure stand and step over towards the dais. It mounts the step and stands before the altar.

Sakari eases back from the tunnel entrance and indicates silently to the others.
