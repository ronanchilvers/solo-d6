"... And then it was gone. Nothing there when I looked again." - [[Okan]] shrugs - "It was dark - probably my imagination after being in Armas' company again."

[[Okan]], [[Kaapo]] and [[Sakari]] and seated in the main tap room of [[The Splintered Stair]], enjoying the heat from the roaring blaze in the hearth. [[Okan]] is steaming slightly in the warmth as his sodden clothes dry out. [[Sakari]]'s fur is so thick that he almost dry already but poor [[Kaapo]] is shivering and sneezing generously every few minutes.

The barmaid comes over with their dinner - fishballs with mixed green vegetables - and conversation stops while they eat. [[Sakari]] eats his own and then polishes off a second and third helping before asking if either of the others is going to leave any.

After dinner, [[Kaapo]] tells [[Okan]] what they learnt from [[Pallabar Reddlepop|Pallabar]] about the skin fragment.

"Could it have been something like this Lynx creature?" [[Kaapo]]'s voice trembles a little as he speaks. [[Okan]] shakes his head - "It was my imagination, Kaapo. Nothing more tha that."

"Mind you - if you have a little magical something that will help us get a good night's sleep, I'd be interested in hearing about it."

[[Kaapo]] scratches his beard in between shivers - "Think I have something. We can cast it on our rooms. I should have enough I think."

They gather their things together and go up to their rooms. [[Kaapo]] opens his pack and brings out his precious books. Leafing through them he selects a particular parchment. 

"Right - I think this will do it. It can place a protective barrier around our rooms which will alert us if broken by one with malign intent. That's what it says it does anyway!"

He moves out into the corridor so he can see the doors of their rooms. Then concentrating hard, he infants the spell.

> [!roll] Kaapo to cast the protective spell over their rooms
> **Result:** 5

As he finishes the last phrase of the incantation the parchment begins to smoke and then suddenly crumbles in a flash of fiery light. They feel a force descend around them, shrouding their rooms, invisible but tangible to them. [[Okan]] shudders - "I hate it when you do that.  Makes me feel funny. Going to bed." - He turns and goes into his room, the door swinging shut behind him. [[Sakari]] does the same leaving [[Kaapo]] in the corridor. He waits for a moment until he feels the magic of the spell root itself into the floor boards. Then he too vanishes into his room.
