The three adventurers are hunkered down behind a large stone mausoleum, a little way away from the building Sakari saw Ranjeet enter.

Okan squints against the sunshine and shades his eyes with his hands - "Can't see much from this distance. We need to get closer. Let's keep an eye on it for a little while and then wander over if nothing happens."

They wait for a while, probably half an hour. Sakari nods off and begins snoring very quietly, much to Okan's horror. He gives the kahru a kick to wake him up. Eventually Okan says - "I think we should wander over there. See what's happening, if anything."

Sakari suddenly growls low in his throat. He grabs Okan's arm - "Who is that?" - he points. A small figure is making its way towards the building. It is cloaked and hooded, the hood pulled down over its face. The figure is walking purposefully towards the building entrance. Okan whispers - "Let's let him go in and then we go over there. Are there any windows or any other way he can get out?"

> [!oracle] Are there other windows in the building?

> **Outcome:** No

Sakari shakes his head - "Don't think so. Think it's just the one entrance."

Okan nods - "Right. Saki - you and I will sneak over there and get a peek in the doorway. Kaapo - you can move a bit closer to the building and keep an eye out for anything untoward." Kaapo nods. They begin to creep towards the building through the surrounding monuments and mausoleums. The figure has disappeared inside now and the building looks deserted.

> [!roll] Test - Do they creep well? (Stealth)
> **Result:** 5

Kaapo is following a little way behind. Okan suddenly hears a gasp and then a crunching, crumbling sound. He looks back and sees Kaapo half submerged in a grave. He had put his foot on the wrong part of one of the smaller tombs and it gave way, his foot plunging through into the coffin beneath.

They all freeze, motionless. Even Kaapo, his hand over his mouth, eyes wide,  manages to stifle his shocked cry. Okan stares at the building ahead of them, looking for any hint of movement but there is none. After what seems like an age, he begins to relax. Crouching, he and Sakari creep back to Kaapo. The young man's leg is badly gashed where something in the coffin - a shard of wood maybe, or a nail - has cut into it.

> [!oracle] Is Kaapo still able to walk?
> **Twist Roll:** 1
> **Twist:** NPC Action - Lina Devdan, Inspect Suffering
> **Roll:** 6
> **Outcome:** Yes and...

Sakari inspects the wound, his huge paws surprisingly deft. 

"It's nothing - a scratch only. Looks worse than it is." He quickly tears a strip of cloth from his cloak and bandages Kaapo's leg. The young man stands tentatively, then grins sheepishly. 

"Feels fine!" - He hefts his bag back onto his shoulder. "Let's go!"

They creep forwards again. The building is quiet with no sign of the figure that entered. They edge closer until finally Okan whispers - "Wait here. I'll go and look."

Kaapo and Sakari crouch behind a wall. Okan peeks out, checking one last time to see if anything is around. Then he flits across to the wall of the building as stealthy as he can.

> [!roll] Test - Okan stealth
> **Result:** 6

He flattens himself against the wall and calms his breathing. Then he inches along until he can peer around the front, peeking between the wall and an ornate pillar.

> [!oracle] Does he see anything remarkable?
> **Twist Roll:** -
> **Twist:** None
> **Roll:** 2
> **Outcome:** No

As his eyes get used to the shadows within the building he can see what looks like a fairly standard mausoleum interior. There is a flight of three steps leading up to a raised dais, upon which is a stone sarcophagus. At the rear of the dais is an ornate statuary scene - some sort of conflict between a monstrous creature and a seemingly noble heroic knight who has pinned it to the ground with his lance. The statue is huge and takes up the entire width of the dais. Okan listens carefully but hears nothing - just the twitter of birds nearby and the faint rustle of leaves in the bushes and trees.

He edges back down the side of the building, away from the front and then cautiously beckons to Sakari and Kaapo, indicating they should be quiet.

> [!roll] Test - Sakari / Kaapo Stealth
> **Result:** 5

They pad quickly across to him, flattening themselves against the wall. Okan whispers - "I can't see anything. No sign of anyone in there. Must be some other way out. I vote we go in and have a look." Sakari nods and silently readies his war axe. Kaapo swallows nervously, hesitates for a moment and then nods.

They creep forward until they are at the front of the building again. Okan looks around them for anything out of the ordinary.

> [!roll] Test - Perception Test for Okan
> **Result:** 4

Satisfied that they are unobserved, he eases forward, the huge bulk of Sakari next to him. They step cautiously into the shadow of the building. Okan scans the place for any signs of activity.

> [!roll] Test - Perception Test for Okan
> **Result:** 2

He sees nothing untoward - everything seems to be as they might expect in a tomb. Okan frowns and whispers - "They must have gone somewhere. Round the back of the statue?"

He cautiously edges round towards the back of the enormous statue. Seen up close, the monstrous creature is fairly terrifying - Kaapo feels intense relief that the thing is solid stone rather than flesh and blood.

> [!oracle] Do they see some sort of exit behind the statue?
> **Twist Roll:** -
> **Twist:** None
> **Roll:** 6
> **Outcome:** Yes and...

Almost simultaneously, Okan and Sakari (who is edging round the other side of the statue) see what seems to be a doorway in the back of the statue. The door is made to look like the statue and is slightly ajar. If it had been closed, it would have been extremely hard to spot. They move round behind the statue. Okan whispers - "Saki - get your axe ready. Kaapo - get ... whatever it is you get ready, ready!!"

They ready themselves and then Okan, hooking his fingers round the edge of the door, gently pulls it open. Their tension eases slightly - inside is a dark space with the top steps of what seems to be a stone staircase, leading downwards. Okan peers down it but sees nothing. He looks at the others.

"We've come this far - might as well carry on?" He raises his eyebrows questioningly at them both. They nod. Sakari steps forward - "I go first little goblin friend." He grins a toothy grin and ducking his head, enters. Okan glances at Kaapo - "Nearly enough nobility to bring a tear to my eye!". THey follow their companion in.
