Sakari shifts a little, easing cramped muscles. He is seated, uncomfortably, on cold stone behind a large mausoleum. He has been sitting for some time watching the entrance to a smaller building a little way off, the entrance through which the creature from the tavern vanished a little while ago. He could see it was wounded and easily tracked it through the streets of the Trades Ward to the edge of the City of the Dead, Waterdeep's huge park and cemetery. Now he sits waiting to see if anyone else arrives.

He shifts position again and then freezes as he sees a figure approaching. The sky is just beginning to lighten - sunrise isn't far off.

> [!roll] Test - Can Sakari see who the figure is?
> **Result:** 6

He peers through the gloom and sees a figure, dressed in the livery of Lady Devdan - Okan had described it after their visit to her. It is a man, tall and thin with a grim look on his face. He wonders if it is the unpleasant butler, [[Ranjeet]] that Okan mentioned. The man disappears inside the building.

> [!oracle] Does Wellby turn up?
> **Twist Roll:** 5
> **Twist:** None
> **Roll:** 3
> **Outcome:** No but...

Sakari watches, waiting to see what will happen. He decides to edge closer to the building to see if he can see anything. 

> [!roll] Test - Stealthily edge closer
> **Result:** 6

He cautiously pads through the darkness, slipping between the burial monuments and working his way closer to the building. He manages to get very close, close enough to hear muttering inside. Then he freezes as the man emerges from the shadows of the doorway again. He walks up quickly away from the building, clearly leaving. As he does so he passes close by where Sakari is hiding. Sakari hears him say

"Dammit Wellby! Why couldn't you be in time for once."

There is more muttering that he can't quite catch. The man vanishes down the path away from the building and all is silent again. Sakari relaxes for a moment. He could go further and see if he can discover more about this building and the creature within it. Or he could go back to find the others and tell them what he's discovered.

He decides to go back and find Okan and Kaapo and tell them about his discovery. He's also feeling hungry. He edges away from the building as stealthily as he can.

> [!roll] Test - Stealthily leave the area
> **Result:** 3

He edges away from the building. He has gone a little way when he brushes against an ornament on one of the tombs. It creates a little, seeming very loud in the darkness.

> [!roll] Test - does the lynx hear the sound?
> **Result:** 5 (notice/perception)

He freezes, waiting to see if anything happens, watching the entrance to the building. For a moment he thinks all is ok and then he notices a deeper darkness move in the doorway. Something, probably the creature, is standing just inside the entrance. It is watching, looking for trouble. Sakari stays still as a statue, not daring to move.

> [!oracle] Does the lynx come out to investigate?
> **Twist Roll:** 1
> **Twist:** Physical event appears, Strangely Fancy
> **Roll:** 1
> **Outcome:** No and...

Sakari begins to wonder if he can risk moving when a dim glow appears at the top of the building. Gradually the glow moves, lighting up the very tip of the odd but highly intricate gargoyles on the roof. Sakari is, for a moment, confused and then realises - sunrise! Sakari sees the shadow in the entrance move and vanish into the depths of the building. Without wasting any more time, he pads quietly away, taking care not to disturb any more of the stonework. Once he is a safe distance away, he relaxes and begins to make his way back across town to the docks, intent on finding Okan and Kaapo. They must know about his discoveries!
