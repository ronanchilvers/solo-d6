Okan walks slowly around the dais in the centre of the room, staring hard at the ground - "There must be another way out of here. That creepy dude didn't just vanish, surely!" He glares at the odd idol in the centre - "And you're just creepy!" The idol seems to be made of polished wood, black and gleaming in the ligh of the torches still burning on the walls. The idol is in the form of a figure, standing with arms open and palms up. The eyes are closed. On the head is a tiara studded with gems.

Sakari is chopping bits off the lynx corpses, much to Kaapo's disgust! "Do you have to do that Saki? Its horrible" - The kahru shrugs - "How else will I know I killed them? Ah - that's better!" - An lynx ear tears free and he straightens up, tucking the remnant into his armour. Kaapo shakes his head - "Truly disgusting."

> [!roll] Test - Okan to find a hidden entrance in the dais
> **Result:** 4

Okan shakes his head - "There's nothing here. Not a thing! There must be some way other way out of here - I feel it in my bones! Kaapo - can you do something to help? Wave your hands around or something?"

Kaapo scratches his head - "I'm not sure what I'd do. Hold on - let me see what I have."

> [!oracle] Does Kaapo have a scroll that might help?
> **Roll:** 33 (50/50)
> **Outcome:** Yes
> **Random Event:** None (ignore as existing random event present)

After a few minutes he stands up - "This might help. It makes hidden things visible." Okan rubs his hands together - "Great! Okay do your thing then." - He wiggles his fingers in front of him. Kaapo shakes his head - "You'd never make a mage. Poor motor skill in your digits." As Okan opens his mouth to protest he says - "Shut up and let me concentrate."

He unfurls a scroll he has taken from his backpack. Clearing his throat he intones the words on the scroll. Okan and Sakari both feel a tingle of power as the magic flows out of the scroll into Kaapo's voice.

> [!roll] Test - Kaapo casts True Seeing spell
> **Result:** 6

As the Kaapo speaks the last words of the spell, his eyes begin to glow, dimly at first but then brighter. He gazes around the room.

"I see no hidden doors." - His voice is strangely resonant - "There is something odd about the dais though. By that idol in the center." He steps forwards onto the dais and reaches out to touch a certain spot on the idol. Almost immediately there is a grating sound and a section of the floor hinges downwards. Okan claps his hands - "Oh well done Kaapo! I knew you could do it!"

Kaapo peers into the darkness below - "There's a stairway here. It goes down into what looks like a dungeon of some sort. I can see barred doors and a corridor."

Okan says - "For once, my timid magical friend, you get to go first! Down we go."

Kaapo reluctantly picks up his bag and edges down the stairway beneath the idol. At the bottom they find themselves standing in a tunnel. The torches above casts a small pool of light down the stair but beyond a few feet it is pitch dark. Kaapo says - "I think there's someone .. or something ... in this cell."

He steps forward gingerly and peers through the bars of the cell door.

> [!abstract] Prisoner in the cell
> **Modifier**: Subtle
> **Noun**: Globetrotter
> **Motive Verb**: Fulfill 
> **Motive Noun**: Envy

Inside the cell a figure is hunched in the corner. Sakari has grabbed one of the torches from above and now shines it into the cell. The figure holds its arm up to shade it's face. They can see that it's a woman. She appears to be in her mid 30s, with blond hair cut shoulder length, an angular face and bright blue eyes. Her clothes suggest that she isn't used to being in places like this - they've seen better days but are still clearly well made and of fine cloth.

Okan says - "Saki - watch the corridor. Kaapo and I'll deal with this." Sakari nods and peers into the gloom of the dungeon. Okan says - "Now you. What's your name? What are you doing here?"

The woman struggles to sit up, a chain round her ankle clanking as she does so. When she speaks, her voice hoarse but clear and well accented.

"My name is Rihanna. I'm a prisoner here. I've been locked up for days, maybe weeks - I can't really tell. Please help me!"

Okan nods - "We'll help you but you need to answer some questions first. Who locked you up?"

> [!oracle] Is Rihanna a spy who has fallen foul of the politics of her organisation?
> **Roll:** 20 (Nearly certain)
> **Outcome:** Yes
> **Random Event:** *None*

> [!abstract] NPC attitude
> **Result:** 55 (Distrustful)
> **Outcome:** Neutral

> [!oracle] Does she tell them the truth?
> **Roll:** 42 (Very unlikely)
> **Outcome:** No
> **Random Event:** *None*

Rihanna shields her eyes again - "I don't know. I was out in the Market, it was late and on my way home someone grabbed me from behind. The next thing I knew I woke up here, chained to the wall. I don't know who they were and I don't care. I just want to get out! Please help me!" Her eyes begin to well up with tears.

> [!roll] Test - Okan / Kaapo to guess if she is lying
> **Result:** 2

Okan says - "Did you see or hear anything of them? A scrap of clothing? A voice?" - Rihanna shakes her head - "It happened so fast - one minute I was walking home, thinking what a beautiful night it was and the next I was knocked on the head and woke up here in the dark."

Okan rubs his chin thoughtfully. Then he says - "Did you see a figure some through here a little while ago? They had a cloak. Would have been in a hurry probably."

> [!oracle] Does she tell the truth?
> **Roll:** 33 (Very likely)
> **Outcome:** Yes
> **Random Event:** *Ignored*

Rihanna nods - "Yes!! I did! They came through, past my cell and went up those stairs. A little while later they ran back down. They were in a huge hurry! Who was it?"

Okan shrugs - "We were hoping you could tell us. It seems not."

Rihanna pulls at the chain round her ankle - "Can you take this off? My leg is so sore." Okan nods down at the padlock which secures it to her leg. He looks at Kaapo - "Think you can do something with that?" Kaapo shrugs - "I can try." - He sets down his bag and kneeling by the woman, he flexes his hands and then, holding them over the padlock he concentrates hard.

> [!roll] Test - Kaapo attempting to undo the lock by magic
> **Result:** 5

There is a pause. Bluish light leaks down from his hands to touch the rock and as it does so, the lock clicks open. Okan pulls the chain free and helps Rihanna to stand.

"Can you walk?"

Rihanna tries a step but she is quite weak from lack of food.

> [!oracle] Is Rihanna as weak as she looks?
> **Roll:** 86 (50/50)
> **Outcome:** No
> **Random Event:** *None*

She leans heavily on Okan as he helps her towards the doorway. Out in the corridor Sakari, squints along the passageway. He can see a dim glow ahead of him. He calls back to the others - "Kappo! Come here, tell me what you see..." The young mage hurries forward to him and Sakari gestures down the corridor - "What is that glow?"

Kaapo peers down the corridor. After a moment he says - "I can see the end of the passageway. The glow is coming from the floor. It looks like some sort of rune or symbol. I can't see anyone down there."

Sakari edges forward - "Stay behind me." - his voice is soft but his words end in a low growl. They move slowly up the corridor until they can see the glowing symbols more clearly.

> [!roll] Test - Does Kaapo recognise the runes?
> **Result:** 4 (eidetic memory - pass)

Kaapo mutters - "Those are runes of travelling. It's some sort of teleportation device I think. A gateway to send whoever uses it to a specific location. Let me see if I can work out where..."

> [!oracle] Can the runes reveal the destination of the gateway?
> **Roll:** 06 (50/50)
> **Outcome:** Extreme yes
> **Random Event:** *None*

> [!oracle] Location descriptor
> Calm Cold

Kaapo bends down and begins to trace the runic characters with his finger, the tip just hovering above but not touching - "Mmm hm. Interesting... unusual choice of characters." He straightens up - "Well... I can tell where this gateway goes and how to use it."

> [!oracle] Will the gateway transport them to Icewind Dale?
> **Roll:** 9 (Very unlikely)
> **Outcome:** Yes
> **Random Event:** *None*

He turns it Sakari - "If we stand on these runes and utter the correct words, they will transport us to Ten Towns in Icewind Dale some 600 miles north of Waterdeep."

Sakari looks at him, his eyes a little wide, the only sign that he is impressed - "Do you know the right words?" - Kaapo nods - "Yes - they're quite straightforward."

Sakari looks at him for a moment, his expression thoughtful - "You learn a lot from those books you read, huh? Maybe I should start reading... then again..."

They walk back to where Okan is waiting for them with Rihanna. They tell him of their discovery. Okan nods - "Let's get out of here for a while. I need some fresh air!!"
