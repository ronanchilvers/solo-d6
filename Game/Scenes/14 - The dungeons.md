Okan walks slowly around the dais in the centre of the room, staring hard at the ground - "There must be another way out of here. That creepy dude didn't just vanish, surely!" He glares at the odd idol in the centre - "And you're just creepy!" The idol seems to be made of polished wood, black and gleaming in the ligh of the torches still burning on the walls. The idol is in the form of a figure, standing with arms open and palms up. The eyes are closed. On the head is a tiara studded with gems.

Sakari is chopping bits off the lynx corpses, much to Kaapo's disgust! "Do you have to do that Saki? Its horrible" - The kahru shrugs - "How else will I know I killed them? Ah - that's better!" - An lynx ear tears free and he straightens up, tucking the remnant into his armour. Kaapo shakes his head - "Truly disgusting."

> [!roll] Test - Okan to find a hidden entrance in the dais
> **Result:** 4

Okan shakes his head - "There's nothing here. Not a thing! There must be some way other way out of here - I feel it in my bones! Kaapo - can you do something to help? Wave your hands around or something?"

Kaapo scratches his head - "I'm not sure what I'd do. Hold on - let me see what I have."

> [!oracle] Does Kaapo have a scroll that might help?
> **Roll:** 33 (50/50)
> **Outcome:** Yes
> **Random Event:** None (ignore as existing random event present)

After a few minutes he stands up - "This might help. Faerie Fire - it makes hidden things visible." Okan rubs his hands together - "Great! Okay do your thing then." - He wiggles his fingers in front of him. Kaapo shakes his head - "You'd never make a mage. Poor motor skill in your digits." As Okan opens his mouth to protest he says - "Shut up and let me concentrate."

He unfurls a scroll he has taken from his backpack. Clearing his throat he intones the words on the scroll. Okan and Sakari both feels tingle of power as the magic flows out of the scroll into Kaapo's voice.

> [!roll] Test - Kaapo casts True Seeing spell
> **Result:** 6

As the Kaapo speaks the last words of the spell, his eyes begin to glow, dimly at first but then brighter. He gazes around the room.

"I see no hidden doors." - His voice is strangely resonant - "There is something odd about the dais though. By that idol in the center." He steps forwards onto the dais and reaches out to touch a certain spot on the idol. Almost immediately there is a momentary grating sound and a section of the floor hinges downwards. Okan claps his hands - "Oh well done Kaapo! I knew you could do it!"

Kaapo peers into the darkness below - "There's a stairway here. It goes down into what looks like a dungeon of some sort. I can see barred doors and a corridor."

Okan says - "For once, my timid magical friend, you get to go first! Down we go."

Kaapo reluctantly picks up his bag and edges down the stairway beneath the idol. At the bottom they find themselves standing in a tunnel. The torches above casts a small pool of light down the stair but beyond a few feet it is pitch dark. Kaapo says - "I think there's someone .. or something ... in this cell."

He steps forward gingerly and peers through the bars of the cell door.

Iside the cell a figure is hunched in the corner. Sakari has grabbed one of the torches from above and now shines it into the cell. The figure holds its arm up to shade it's face.
