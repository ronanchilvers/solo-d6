Okan and Kaapo sprint through the streets, dodging this way and that to shake off pursuit. The tavern guests are not enthusiastic about the chase and give up quite quickly.

> **Twist Roll:** 1
> **Twist:** Organisation Helps The Hero
> **Roll:** 6
> **Outcome:** Yes and...

They finally stop, panting, in a small alleyway. Okan gazes back down the street to check for pursuit but there is none. Kaapo flops down on the cobblestones. 

"This is a disaster! My stuff is in the tavern!! And yours! And Saki won't know where we are! What in all the hells do we do now?"

Okan holds up a hand - "Don't worry! Saki is a bright fella and he can track a scent for miles. He'll find us. As for our gear - we'll get new stuff. We still have a good bit of the 50 dragons left. Come on! I have an idea of where to go."

They wind their way through the back alleys until they emerge onto the northern end of Fish Street. Okan leads the way down the street until he sees, once again, the front of [[The Jolly Guardian]] up ahead. Since it's the middle of the night, the tavern is dark.

> [!oracle] Are there any lights on in the Jolly Guardian?
> **Twist Roll:** -
> **Twist:** None
> **Roll:** 5
> **Outcome:** 6

As they approach, they can see a faint glimmer of light from one of the front windows. Okan steps up to the door and taps gently.

> [!oracle] Does Armas open the door?
> **Twist Roll:** -
> **Twist:** None
> **Roll:** 1
> **Outcome:** No and...

There no answer and he knocks again. Finally, a small hatch in the door creaks open and a face peers out. A voice says - "Yes?"

![[Rauf]]

> [!oracle] Does Okan know Rauf?
> **Twist Roll:** -
> **Twist:** None
> **Roll:** 5
> **Outcome:** Yes

Okan says - "Rauf? Is that you? Please - we need somewhere to sleep. Can you tell Armas I'm here and need a favour?"

Rauf sniffs slightly and then says - "Master Valtaistuin is not here."

Okan mutters under his breath and then says - "Well... Can we come in anyway? We just need a place by the fireside for the night. I can talk the Armas in the morning."

> [!roll] Test - Persuasion to let them in
> **Result:** 4, Lucky: 5

There is another short pause and then - "Very well. But no mess and no theft. Master Valtaistuin wouldmbe most displeased with either."

Okan nods enthusiastically - "Of course! Fully understood."

The door hatch clicks shut and after a few moments of clinking and scraping, the door swings open. Okan and Kaapo gratefully hurry in out of the night.

> [!oracle] Did Sakari find his way here too?
> **Twist Roll:** -
> **Twist:** None
> **Roll:** 1
> **Outcome:** No and...

Rauf closes and re-locks the door, then leads them through to the main bar where the fire is still glowing in the hearth.

"You may pull up chairs here and sleep. However you will need to be up and presentable when the bar opens in the morning. Master Valtaistuin does not like layabouts."

They both nod wearily. Rauf leaves the room and Okan and Kaapo pull up chairs, make themselves as comfortable as they can be and settle down for what remains of the night. Just before they go to sleep Kaapo says - "I wonder why that thing came after us? I mean I'm assuming that it was the same creature that you glimpsed in the shadows?" Okan replies - "That, my friend, is an excellent question! Someone doesn't want us poking around about this theft. I'm wondering why... ?"
