A little while later, the characters are gathered around the entrance to the mausoleum. Rihanna, still seemingly extremely weak, slumps down on the step. [[Okan]] draws the others aside a little way.

"Look - I don't trust her. Not surprising- I don't trust anyone, with the possible exception of you two. We need to decide what we do with her. Let her go or keep her with us. She must know more than she's letting on. Why on earth would whoever it is kidnap her and then just dump her in a corner!?"

[[Kaapo]] nods "I agree - she must know more than she's letting on."

He says, "I could try to read her mind somehow. I doubt it would work but I could try."

Okan shakes his head - "Probably not a good idea ... yet. Let's try talking to her again - Saki, look threatening." [[Sakari]] nods and grunts.

They move back to where [[Rihanna]] is seated on the steps rubbing her ankles. Okan stands in front of her, Sakari looming huge behind him.

"We don't think you're on the level Rihanna, IF that's your name. We think you know more about what's going on than you're saying. Saki here ... " he nods towards the huge kahru "Saki is keen to ... well ... eat you! He's hungry you see and kahru get funny when they're hungry." Saki growls low in his throat for dramatic effect. [[Okan]] crouches down in front of her.

"Help me to help you - give me something to work with so I can convince him you're worth keeping around."

[[Rihanna]] clears her throat nervously as Sakari looks over her, his claws flexing. She holds her hands up - "Wait... wait! Ok - I've not been entirely truthful." She grins nervously. "I don't know you - I don't know whose side you're on."

Okan shrugs - "We're on our side of course! Although to be honest I didn't know there were sides to be on..."

Rihanna shrugs - "There are always sides to be on. That's how the world is." - She rubs her ankles where the chains were. Her face is tired as she looks up at Okan.

"I'm from Icewind Dale, up in the north. I've been in Waterdeep for weeks. I travelled here looking for something, an artifact that is sacred to my people. It was stolen from us and I have sworn an oath to recover it."

Okan frowns down at her - "Do you know who stole it?"

Rihanna nods - "It was a merchant by the name of Devdan, Lina Devdan. She visited the Dale early last year. She brought many goods to the Ten Towns, goods that we don't often see. In the spring she left and it was only later we discovered that thieves in her employ had broken into one of our temples and stolen the... the... well - the artifact. Forgive me, it is forbidden for me to speak of it to unbelievers."

Okan, Sakari and Kaapo gaze first at her and then each other. Okan says quietly to his companions "Are you thinking what I'm thinking?" Kaapo gives him a thin smile. Okan turns to Rihanna.

"This artifact - it wouldn't take the shape of a cup would it? A jewelled cup?"

Her face goes pale - "How did you know?"

Okan grins, grimly - "It's a long story. I'm wondering though - how did you end up chained to the wall? And where does the fellow we've been tracking fit into this?"

Rihanna says - "I've found no trace of the artifact but I did discover that others have an interest in it. When I arrived in Waterdeep I went to see Lina Devdan. She ordered me out of her house, saying that she had no idea what I was talking about. I decided to watch the house and for two days I sat in the rain and dark. Late in the evening, a few nights ago, I saw figures on the roof. They passed me unaware of my presence - a thing like a huge lynx and a shorter figure, a halfling. I saw the halfling enter the house and emerge carrying something. As he wrapped it in a cloth I saw what it was - our artifact, our sacred chalice."

"Stupidly, as it turns out, I followed them. They led me across the city, a meandering route, to this place. I should have known something was amiss - as we left the more populous streets, the lynx creature vanished and I couldn't see where it went. Then, before I knew what was happening, it had crept up on me, pinned me to the ground. The halfling came then and he would have killed me I think, but something stayed his hand. They dragged me inside and questioned me. It didn't take long for them to find out my purpose."

"Before I left the Dale, my teacher gave me a gift for when I found the chalice. It was a scroll of travelling and when uttered opens a portal to the Dale which lasts for a couple of days I think. It was so that I could return quickly rather than risk an arduous journey with the chalice. When he searched me, the halfling found it. They dragged me down into that dungeon and forced me to use the scroll to open the portal. He said they had business with the chalice in the north, in the Dale. He left me for hours in the dark with only the flickering light of the portal to see by."

"When he returned, I think he was on the verge of killing me. He spoke about some rite he had to perform but then the lynx creature seemed to warn him of something and he went to the upper chambers. I suppose it was your arrival the creature warned of - the next thing I knew, he was running back down the stairs and without saying anything, picked up the bag containing the chalice and ran through the portal."

Okan raises his eyebrows - "That's quite a story!"

Rihanna says - "I saw something else as well, when he was questioning me - a ring the halfling was wearing. A ring with a symbol on it - a descending dragon, mouth agape, surrounded by flame. The symbol of the Zhentarim."

> [!roll] Does Okan recognise the name Zhentarim?
> **Result:** 4,5

Okan looks down at her for a long moment, his face suddenly pale. Then he looks at Kaapo and Sakari. His voice is slightly hoarse as he says

"That's not good"
